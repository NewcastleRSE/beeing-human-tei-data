                    delicate Silk-worme have in some hoter Climates disproved; (for in the colder
                    countries, such as is our Iland of <placeName rend="italic"

                    their profit; and doe content themselves with the beholding of their queint

                    received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health and necessity.
                    But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bee is so great and

                    thought it a subject fit for their penns. Unto which I may adde infinite others

                    foure Bees brought one of them downe betweene them, pulling and haling her as if

                    also bigger than a hony-Bee, but not so bigge as a Drone, although somewhat

                    reach but to the middle of hir traine or nether part: hir legges proportionable,

                    part so long, and halfe so long as hir upper part, more picked than a small
                    Bees, having it in foure joynts or partitions, and in each joynt a golden barre,
                    in stead of those three whitish rings which other Bees have at their three
                    partitions. The speere she hath is but little, and not halfe so long as the

                    better to stand upon your guard, then to trust to their gentlenesse. For the
                    safeguard of your face (which they have most mind unto) provide a purs-hood made
                    of course boultering, to be drawn and knit about your collar: which, for more
                    safetie, is to bee lined against the eminent parts with Woollen-cloth. First,
                    cut a peece about an inch and a halfe broad, and halfe a yard long, to reach
                    round by the temples and fore-head from one eare to the other: which being sowed
                    in his place, joyne unto it two short peeces of the same bredth under the eyes,
                    for the balls of the cheekes: and then for another peece about the bredth of a
                    shilling against the top of the nose. In stead of this, you may use a Cypres
                    Band or a Boulter, having a Handkerchiefe betweene your fore-head and it, to
                    beare it out from the skinne, and your hat on your head to hold it fast. And if
                    they be so earnest that you feare stinging your hands, put on a paire of woollen
                    cuffes or gloves. When you have on this Helmet and Gantlets, as a man armed at
                    all points, you may boldly deale with them, being out of <fw type="catch">
                        the</fw>
                    <pb n="C3r"/>
                    <fw type="header"> and of their Queene. </fw> the danger of their poysoned
                    speares. At other times when they are not angried, a little peece halfe a
                    quarter broad to cover the eyes and parts about them, may serve: for then,
                    though it be in the heat of the day, unlesse they may strike about the eyes,
                    they care not to strike at all. </p>

                        Bees dangerous to Cattell.</note> Unto Cattel which have not the reason by
                    flight or otherwise to save themselves they are more dangerous. A Horse in the
                    heat of the day looking over a hedge, on the other side whereof was a stall of
                    Bees, while hee stood nodding with his head, as his manner is, because of the
                    Flies, the Bees fell upon him and killed him. Likewise, I heard of a Teeme that
                    stretching against a hedge, overthrew a stalle on the other side, and so two of
                    the Horses were stung to death. I doubt not but through negligence many such
                    mischances have happened else-where. For this thing hath beene long since
                    observed by that great Philosopher. <quote>

                    there were Bees so wise and skilfull, as not only to descrie a certaine little
                    God a mightie, though he came among them in likenesse of a Wafer-cake; but also
                    to build him an artificiall Chappell. If I should relate the Storie, all men, I
                    know, would not beleeve it: notwithstanding, because every man may make some use
                    of it, you shall have it. </p>

                        A strange tale concerning the knowledge and devotion of Bees.</note> A
                    certain simple woman having some stals of Bees which yeelded not unto hir
                    desired profit, but did consume and die of the murraine; made her mone to
                    another Woman more simple then hir selfe: who have her counsell to get a
                    consecrated Host, and put it among them. According to whose advice she went to
                    the Priest to receive the Host: which when she had done, she kept it in her
                    mouth, and being come home againe she tooke it out, and put it into one of hir
                    Hives. Whereupon the murraine ceased, and the Honie abounded. The Woman
                    therefore lifting up the Hive at the due time to take out the Honie, saw there
                    (most strange to be seene) a Chappell built by the Bees, with an altar in it,
                    the wals adorned by marvellous skill of Architecture, with windowes conveniently
                    set in their places: also a doore and a steeple with bells. And the Host being
                    laid upon the altar, the Bees making a sweet noise, flew round about it. </p>
                <p xml:id="ch1par44">But whether this doe more argue the supernaturall knowledge and
                    skill of the Bees, or the miraculous power of the Host, or the spirituall
                    craftinesse of him, whose comming is by the working of Satan with all power and

                    particular circumstance over narrowly, will make objections against the truth of
                    the Storie: which, by their leaves, in the behalfe of my Author, I must not
                    spare to answer. First, it may be they will object that the Host being held so
                    long in the Womans mouth, could not choose in that space but melt and marre. <fw
                        type="catch"> Indeed,</fw>
                    <pb n="D1r"/>
                    <fw type="header"> and of their Queene. </fw> Indeed, if it did remaine, as it
                    was, a Wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but being turned into flesh, the
                    case is altered. If they shall say that because it was now Honie-harvest, at
                    which time good stals, such as this was, are full of Wax and Honie, that
                    therefore there could not be roome enough for a Chappell with a steeple and
                    bells in it; I answer, that this is as weake and simple as the former. For
                    seeing it is knowne that a Blacke-smith of <placeName>London</placeName> did
                    make a Locke and a Key so little that a flye could draw it; why should not the
                    little Smith of <placeName> Nottingham</placeName>, which doth the worke that no
                    man can, frame a little Chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they will
                    reply, if wee grant you this, yet how could the Bees flie about the altar in
                    that little Chappell, seeing they are scarce able flie in so narrow a close
                    roome as the emptie hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: haply
                    the woman said they did but crawle. If they shall aske how the woman could see
                    the altar with the Host standing in the Chancell, and the Bells hanging in the
                    steeple, seeing the waxen walls were not transparent, they maie easily thinke
                    that the Bees would give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if
                    they shall say that those bells being made of such metall would give but a weake
                    sounde, when they were rung to Mattins; they must consider the Parishoners dwelt
                    not farre off. And so I thinke these captious Criticks will hold themselves
                    satisfied. </p>
                <p xml:id="ch1par45">Unto this Storie my Author immediately addeth an other, like
                    unto it, and as likely: how certaine Theeves having stollen the Silver Box
                    wherein the Wafer-Gods use to lye, and finding one of them there, being loth,
                    belike, that hee should lye abroad all night, did not cast him away, but laid
                    him under a Hive: whom the Bees acknowledging, advanced to an high roome in the
                    Hive, and there in stead of his silver boxe, made him another of the whitest
                    Waxe: and when they had so done, in worship of him, at set houres they sung most
                    sweetly beyond all measure about it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight,
                    with a light and all. Wherewith the Bishop being made acquainted, came thither
                    with many others: and lifting up the Hive he saw there <fw type="catch">

                    it, and keeping watch in the night, as Monkes do in their Cloisters. The Bishop
                    therefore taking the Host carried it with the greatest honour into the Church:
                    whither many resorting, were cured of innumerable diseases. </p>
                <p xml:id="ch1par46">I doubt not, but some incredulous people wil quarrell this
                    Storie as well as the former: making question, since the combs in the top of the
                    Hive, are not past halfe an inch one from an other, how there could be roome for
                    a boxe of that bredth that would containe the Host; and then being there, how it
                    might be seene by the Bishop, seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees,
                    and the Storie saith, that they were then singing about it: and therefore
                    perhaps they will suspect the whole Narration, supposing it rather to be an
                    unadvised device of some idle Monke, which, if he had consulted with them that
                    have skill among Bees, might have made his tale more probable. Alledging
                    moreover, that therefore there is no mention made of my particular person, time,
                    or place, lest the circumstances should disprove the matter it selfe. All which
                    objections I could as easily answer as the former, if I thought it needfull; But
                    now because some may be as ready to mistrust my relation, as others are to
                    object against the truth of the Stories; I will here in mine owne behalfe for

                    take that in for a litche. If the litches be too short for the worke, plucke
                    them up higher about the necke as you goe. When you have wrought up to the

                    alter his course, making the daies longer or shorter, the aire warmer or colder,

                    round cels of the bignesse of grapes, lying flat on the ground one upon another
                    without any order: the which are made after this manner. First either upon the

                    and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to live, it groweth into so
                    many severall Cells, as there are grubs, each one having one to himselfe. When
                    they become to their bignesse, the Cells, which before were browne and brittle,
                    doe now wax white and tough, that you can scarce teare them. And when the Dorres
                    are ripe, they gnaw their way out at the top. Upon these they make more in like
                    manner, and the void open Cells they fill with Honie, wherewith they feed both
                    themselves and their young, when the weather suffreth them not to flie abroad.

                    out of doubt, within a moneth after when they are ripe, doe openly engender with
                    their females, as the chaffers doe, but their mates they choose in the neast,
                    and are carried away by them. After which time the females breed no more till

                    Hive of the same size and compasse: make ready also two square stickes 13. or
                    14. inches long; and an inch thicke at one end, and halfe an inch at the other:

                    so save the Bees, that otherwise might be prest to death betweene the two
                    skirts. Then in a faire night, so soon as it is dark, reare the full Hive with

                    take off the upper hive or <term>Receiver,</term> &amp; set him upon the stoole

                    may conveniently put the Hive under it; having first removed the twigs round
                    about, that stand in your way, shake the Bees into the Hive: and when you have
                    set the Hive right upon the Rests, take up two corners of the Mantle at the ends
                    of the Rests, and pinne them together upon the top of the Hive, to stay the Bees
                    running out sodainely: and then returning to the bough, shake it againe, and
                    turne it aside out of his place, or cover it with your body, or with some cloth:
                    and then presently loose the corners of the Mantle, and spread them againe. When
                    they begin to cease running into the Hive, if you see them lie thicke upon the
                    Mantle, shake them to the Hive-skirts: and the rest, as well upon the Hive as
                    the Mantle, drive in gently with your Brush. So shall you easily and quietly
                    Hive them. Otherwise having first taken away the twigs that may let you, cut off
                    the bough or boughes (for sometime they wil hang upon many): and if you doubt

                    fast as they come they are beaten and killed. And those that escaping thence goe
                    back to their old home, finde no better entertainment: and those few that escape
                    thence, desperately runne into any other Hives, and so leape out of the
                    Frying-pan into the fire. And therefore when the swarme is hived, if you see
                    part begin to gather together by themselves; remove them as speedily as you can,
                    that they may goe to their fellowes in time. </p>

                    shaking them off the bough, and by wiping them downe that are on the out-side of
                    the Hive. Which, when they are up, will make such a noise, that their fellowes

                    And if you aske why they should finde so hard entertainment in their old home
                    from whence they came, it is because they went away with a Leader of their owne,

                    the setling with shaking, gentle rubbing with weeds, and spitting and blowing in
                    the place, that they may goe to their fellowes. If they bee setled and hang upon
                    a bough, cut the bough and bring them to them. If they bee setled in some other
                    place, then put them in a hive without Spleets: and if they bee within a pearch
                    of the other part, move them both, one towards an other by little and little

                    about an houre after my sonne found the other dead on the ground. When they had
                    thus mercilessly murdered both the Queenes, and the better part of the swarmes;
                    they that escaped rose all out of the Hive, and went into another swarme which
                    stood behinde them: of which, because they brought no Ruler with them, they were
                    quietly received. </p>

                    without defence, and the missing of their Prince. And this specially in a

                    swarme being knit, missing her, began to unknit, and be gone: which I perceiving

                    therefore some use to do so, when two swarmes are put together, that they may
                    seeme to be of one companie. If these usual helps be no helps, what help is
                    there then? If you perceive their fighting in time before any great harme be
                    done, then this must you doe. First stop them up close that none can passe
                    either in or out, leaving onely a breathing place. Then shal you have a double
                    conflict; one within, an other without. The theeves that are within, having no
                    way to escape with their preyes, first or last will be slaine all. They that are
                    without, after a little wrestling, seeing nothing to be had but blowes, will not
                    long abide this bootlesse danger. When you perceive the siege to be raised, and
                    that there is little or no fighting without; (which will be about an houre
                    after) then may you let out your Bees, making the doore halfe an inch high, and
                    scarce halfe an inch wide. Those few that were within will they bring forth to
                    buriall; some then, some on the morrow. In the evening, when the Bees are all
                    in, shut them up as before. The next day betimes, before the Bees would be
                    abroad, must you looke for some of them againe. When they are come, beat them
                    away with a bough, but kill them not: for so may you do your neighbour a shrewd
                    turne, and your selfe too. </p>

                        Private feeding.</note> The manner of feeding Bees in their Hives is divers.
                    Some give them Honie in a spoone: but that way many of them be-smeare their
                    wings: and if their fellowes licke them not cleane presently, before the cold
                    chill them, they die. Others, to avoid this inconvenience, give it them in a
                    warme Toste: but this way wasteth the hony, &amp; doth not altogether avoid the
                    former inconvenience. Others have other devices. But indeed the only good way to
                    feed Bees is with a combe, after this manner. First, take a fresh Combe of
                    Live-honie out of a Hive, &amp; lay it upon some Prop or stay, that the Bees may
                    worke, as well under as upon. This Prop may be a woodden grate seven or eight
                    inches square, made of two sides halfe an inch deepe, and three ribs fastened
                    into them with Dove-railes, or with small nailes. For a need two severall square
                    stickes may serve: but then you cannot so quickly either see it in, or take it
                    out. </p>
                <p xml:id="ch8par11">Then in a faire calme evening (when the heat of the day, and
                    the Bees worke is past) place this upon the stoole: so that the Feeding-combe be
                    reared as neere the Hive-combes as may be, not touching them, lest the Bees
                    fasten this and them together. Then see that the Hive, set downe in his place,
                    be close every where: and at the doore but room enough for a Bee or two to
                    passe. Then will these Bees to worke afresh, not ceasing day nor night untill
                    they have rid the Combe cleane: which within eight and fortie houres will be
                    effected. If they need any more, the next evening doe <fw type="catch">

                    waxeth darke, and the Bees are all in; barre up the doore: and let them not out
                    till the next evening, when other Bees are quiet. Or if you doe it in the
                    morning, be sure also to take out the Combe, whether he be rid or no. And still
                    leave the Hive close, with a narrow passage. </p>

                        Carelesse feeding is starving.</note> If your poore Bees should not be thus
                    defended from strangers, the feeding of them would prove a starving of them. For
                    the Borderers smelling the bootie will be sure to have part of it, if they can

                    all: as often it falleth out through this carelesnesse. Which causeth some to
                    condemne all feeding of Bees, as painfull and fruitlesse: saying, If you feed
                    them not, they can but die: and so will they doe when you have bestowed your
                    labour and cost. But this is disproved by experience: for those, which being fit

                        themselves in heart. For such I have kept nine or ten yeeres: and I have
                        heard of some of a greater age. Moreover, all stalls of three yeeres old and
                        upward, that have mist swarming two yeeres together: and especially those,
                        that having lyen forth the summer before, did not cast this last summer: for
                        such doe seldome after prosper. It is therefore better to take them now
                        while they are good, than in a vaine hope of increase, to keep them till
                        they perish. Likewise if you have any that are very fat and full of Honie,
                        (as some yeeres some will be, even down to the Stoole) those are ripe and
                        ready to yeeld their fruit. One such is worth three or foure. Take them

                        as much as may suffice to boile it. And cast in also a little Niter: all
                        this set over a soft fire. When it hath boiled up twice or thrice, lift the
                        vessell from the fire, and, the wax being presently cooled with cold water,
                        take it out: and when you have scraped off the drosse, if any such hang on,
                        and put it into other Salt water, seeth it againe. And having boiled up
                        twice or thrice, as before, lift it from the fire againe. And then take the
                        bottom of an other earthen pot, or a little round board with a handle in the
                        middle like a Churn-staffe, but without holes: and having first wetted the
                        bottom of it in cold water, dip it into the hot vessell, and assoone as this
                        wet bottom toucheth the wax, pull it out againe, and you shall have sticking
                        to the bottom a thin cake: which when you have taken off, wet the bottom
                        againe, and dip it as before: and thus do till you have taken up all the wax
                        in cakes. These cakes hang in the open aire upon a line drawne through them,
                        so that they may not touch one an other, besprinkling them with water in the
                        Sun-shine untill they be white. If any man would have wax whiter, let him
