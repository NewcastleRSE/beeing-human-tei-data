##CHAP.7/##
\1 *The Bees enimies are many./*/
{T}He good Bee, as other good things, hath many enimies, from which she needeth your help to defend her: namely, 1.the mouse, 2.the woodpecker, 3.the titmouse, 4.the swalow, 5.the hornet, 6.the waspe, 7.the moth, 8.the snaile, 9.the emet 10.the spider, 11.the toade, 12.the frogge, 13.the Bee, and 14.the weather.
\2. *The mouse/*/ The mouse, whether he be of the field or of the house, is a dangerous enimy. For if he get into a hive he makes havocke of the hony, and so starves the Bees. Some enter by the dore, or by some open place in the skirtes of the hive: some gnaw a hoale through in the toppe of the hive, where they know the hony lieth. Some keepe their old homes, and come to the hive only for their baits: some make their neasts betweene the hacle and the hive, that they maie the sooner and the safer come to the hony at their pleasure. 
\3 *How to know when a mouse is in the hive./*/ When a mouse is in the hive, if it be in the day-time, you may know by the Bees: for they [cw: will]

wil sodainly flie forth, as when they swarme, & that so eagerly and angerly, that you may easily know they doe not play, as sometime they use to do, *v./* \*V.c./* I.n.57./ when they are wel pleased: neither wil they cease flying about, until he be gone. But for the most part they steale in the night, when the Bees will not stirre. 
\4. *Remedies against the mouse./*/ For remedy, first you must looke that your hives, whether they be of straw or wicker, be close and fast wrought. For if the strawe bee loose and soft, they will more easily gnawe their way through: & if the wicker be thinne, when they have torne down the cloome, they wil creepe in betweene the twigges. Next see that the hives bee dawbed close round about the skirtes, that there bee no entring but by the dore: which in the end of *Taurus,/* when the Bees come downe to watch, and thenceforth all the sommer, they wil keep wel enough both day and night: but in the winter, at which time the mise make most spoile, it must bee made so narrow, that they cannot get in. *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./* 24 *&/* 26./ Also it behooveth you to remoove all thinges about your hives, that may hide and harbor them: for they will feare to come and goe in fight, lest the cat meete with them by the waie. Moreover it is good now and then, in drie and warme daies to take of the hacles, as well to meete with the mise, as to ayre the moist hives, and to kill [cw: mothes,]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$
mothes, and spiders, and the like. Those mise that neastle upon the top of the hive, when the hacle is taken of, will sit amazed so long, that you may be sure to crush them against the hive with your hand. 5 Lastly you shal doe wel to set baited traps in their waie, that so they may come short. 
\2.*The wood-pecker/*/ The wood-pecker or yippingale, if hee find any hoale in the hive against the hony, doth with his long round tongue draw it out: but hee doth more harme to wood-bees then garden-bees.
\3. *The Tit-mouse./*/ Of Tit-mise there are three sorts. The great Titmouse is a very harmful bird. For although sometime he seem contented with dead Bees, yet is he a great devourer of the quick also. In winter he taketh them at the hive, as they come forth: and in very cold weather when they are loath to stir, he wil stand at the dore, & there never leave knocking til one come to see who is there: and then sodainely catching her away he flies with her: and when he hath eaten her, he comes againe for more: eight or nine will scarce serve his turn at once. But in the spring when the Bees come to the palme, he standeth there watching for them, and while they are busie at their worke he devoureth many. The little russet one in winter feedeth onely on dead Bees; but in the spring hee wil take part with the great one. The little greene Titmouse [cw: I]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

I cannot accuse. 
The swallow taketh them as they fly, *populatur hir undo,/* & alibi *ea demum sola avium non nisi in volatu pascitur/*: \Nat hist.l.II.c.18/ \Nat hist. l.10.c.24./ But I am perswaded she doth much lesse harme then the Titmouse, although she have a worse name. \7 *The swallow/*/ These birds therefore are not to be suffered.
*Absint meropesq aliæq volucres 
Et manibus Progne pectus signata cruentis./*
\8. *Remedy against the titmouse and swallow./*/  Let boies destroie their neasts in sommer, & kill the old ons in winter with traps and pitfals baited with oats or tallow. *Aristotle/* joineth the waspe, the little titmouse, the swallow, and the great titmouse together. \His.l.9.c.40/ *Inferunt injuriam apibus maxime vespæ, & aviculæ quas paros vocant, atq etiam hirundo, & merops qui apiaster est. Quamobrem apiarii vesparum latibula & hirundinum ac meropum nidos propinquos alveis tollunt./*
\9 *The hornet/*/ The hornet also devoureth Bees, being so much to stong for them, that they can make no resistance; which the Poet meant where he said *aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis./* Hir manner is to fly about before the hive, til she have spied hir pray settled at the dore, and then sodainely she taketh it in hir feet, and flieth away with it as a kite with a chicke. 
\10 *The hornets sting is dangerous./*/ In destroying the hornets you must be wary: for one stinging doth ofttimes cause an ague and lesse then thirtie, as some say, will kill a man. \Nat.hist.l.II.c.21./ *Ictus crabronum baud temere sine febri est./* [cw: *Au/*]
 
===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

*Auctores sunt ter novenis interfici hominem./*
\11 *The waspe/*/ The waspe doth much more hurt then the hornet: for the hornet now and then killeth a Bee, but the waspe wasteth the hony, whereby many whole stalles doe perish. For besides the harme that shee doth hir selfe, shee doth ofttimes set the robber on worke, who, when the waspe hath begun, will be ready to take part with her, add then all goes to wrach. A waspe is by nature harder and stronger then a Bee, specially in *Libra/*: insomuch that ofttimes shee breaketh from two or three of them, though they have all hold of her at once: and perhaps killeth one of them out of hand. \12 *The wasp at first feedeth upon dead Bees./*/ About *Cancer/* shee beginneth to bee bred: *v./* \*v.c./*4.*n./*8./ about *Leo/* and the spring being hot and dry somewhat rather, shee first appeareth: and in a while she beginneth to feed upon dead & weake Bees, which she quickly cutting of in the middle with hir fanges, first carrieth away the nearer part, and anon fetcheth the rest, when she hath bitten of the winges for easier carriage not far from the place where she took it up. \13 *At Virgo she stealeth hony/*/ About *Virgo/* she waxeth bold, and adventureth into the hives for hony: but by reason of the strangenesse of hir voice and habit, she is discried before she come neere: and at the first (while the weather is warme, & the Bees both early and late keepe watch and ward at the [cw: hive-]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$
hive-dore) comming single against many she is commonly beaten back: and if by chance she slip in, she doth not alwaies escape, sometime she is slaine in the hive & brought forth dead; and sometimes she is killed without dores, when she hath got hir pray. But afterward, the weather waxing cold, and specially in mornings & evenings, and the Bees therefore retiring from the dore higher into the hive, the waspes make great spoile among them. And this they continue until *Scorpio/*: after which time they begin to ware. \14 *How long the waspes last/*/ Nevertheles while they live, that is until *Sagit/*, if abundance of cold and wet rid them not a little rather, they wil be filching: & one waspe will carrie out as much as two Bees bring in. In a wet sommer (because they breed for the most part in the ground) much raine rotteth their combes, and chilleth their yong, and so spilleth the increase of them, that your Bees shall not be much troubled with them that yeere. \15 *In what yeer the wasps are most rife./*/ But the sommer being dry they grow very rife and if many dry sommers come together, there wil be such multitudes of them in every place, that, without continual and diligent attendance, you shal be sure of great losse among your Bees by them.
\16 *Remedies against the waspes./*/ Wherefore if you love your Bees, suffer not a wasps neasts about you. The readiest way to rid them is, if they be in the ground, to scalde them; if in a tree or other place, where they build [cw: above]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

above the hoale, so that you cannot scald them, then smother them with brimstone, as you kil Bees. And to destroy those that are acquainted with your hives, set by them sider, vertjoice, sowre drinke, meth, or hony-water in a viol open, or other glasse covered with a paper that hath a hoale in the middle: & so you shall take many: and if the meth or honi-water doe now and then drowne a Bee with them, pitty them not, for they are theeves. \Hist.li.9.c.40./ *Aristotle/* teacheth you an other way. *Impugnatur/* (saith hee) *apes a vespis: quamobrem apiarii eas venantur constituta olla, & carne in ca posita. Ubi enim multæ ad carnem accesserint, apposito operculo super ignem ollam ponunt./* You may also use other meanes to kil them your selfe. How to helpe and defend your Bees against them, see *c./*3.*n./*36,36,38,&39.
\17 *The moth./*/ The flying moth lyeth betweene the hacle and the hive, and breedeth little wormes, or crawling mothes, some in the skirts of the hive, some within upon the stoole, and some without upon the hive, specially in the crackes of the dawbed hives. *Plinie/* speaketh thus of them \Nat.hist.li.II.c.19./ *Papileo etiam ignavus luminibus accensis advolitas pestifer, nec uno modo: nam & ipse ceras depascit, & relinquit excrementa quibus teredines gignuntur./* 
\8. *The snaile/*/ They offend the Bees also with their mealines, as the snailes do with their slimines. Wherfore rid your hives of these guests, and specially of the snailes: which wil not long abide, if there be no [har-] 

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

harbor of long grasse, weeds, or other thing about the hives. 
\19 *The emet./*/ If emets breed neere your Bees, they will much trouble them, biting them, and hanging upon them: although the Bees if they be lustie, wil kil many of them that come to the hive. But if it bee a poore stale, they wil in time posesse the hive and eate up the hony. The best remedy against them is to scald them. 
\20 *The spider./*/ The spider, as the moth, doth use to harbour betweene the hacle and the hive, where commonly she hath a Bee or twaine in store to feed on, an unfit messe for such a mouth: Sometime she hangeth hir nets under the stoole, which easily intangle a wearie Bee, when she commeth laden home, and missing of the lighting-place falleth into them: yea & sometime where the Bees are few, chiefly in the winter, they wil be bold to enter the hive, & there weave their cruell webbes, *In foribus laxos suspendit aranea casses/*, and then are they very dangerous. \Virg.Nat hist. l.11.c.19./ *Aranei quoq vel maxime hostiles: cum prævalvere ut intexant, enecant alveos./*
\21 *The toad./*/ The toad is by nature so noisom to the Bees that while he is about the hive, though hee ly but under the stoole, the Bees will not prosper. \22. *The frog/*/ He is said also to devoure them at the hive, as the frogge at the watring-place. \Hist an.l.9.c.40/ *Rana apes, ubi ad aquam accesserint, rapiunt: quamobrem eas apis arii per paludes & stagna unde apes aquantur vena-/* [cw: *ri/*]

===


$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$
\Ibidem./ *ri solent. Rubeta etiam apes interimit: subiens enim aditus alves afflat, & observans rapit evolantes. Nullo hæc affic: malo ab apibus potest, sed ab apiario facile interimitur./* Item *insidiantur aquantibus ranæ: quæ maxima earum est operatio, tum cum sobolem faciunt v./* \*V.c.6.n./*51./ *Nec hæ tantum quæ stagna rivosq obsident, verum et rubeta veniunt ultro, adrepentesq foribus per eas sufflant: ad hoc provolant, confestimque abripiuntur./*

\23 *The Bee the Bees greatest enimie./*/ But not any one of these, nor al these togither doe halfe so much harme to the Bees, as the Bees. *Apes api, as homo homini, lupus/*. They make the greatest spoile both of Bees & hony. For as they of the same hive live in inviolable peace one with an other: so have they no entercourse, no friendship or society with others, but are rather at perpetual defiance, & deadlie feud with them. In fight they are fierce, and in victory mercilesse within the space of a day, or twaine, yea of 3. or. 4. howres sometime, if the hive be open that they may have easie passage to and fro, they wil have rid him cleane. And therefore all Bees of all their enimies most do feare strange Bees, knowing well in what danger they are to bee robbed by them both of goods and life. \24 *Robbing or fighting of Bees in winter & sommer but litle./*/ This robbing is practised all the yeere. In winter, as oft as the weather is faire & warme, some wil be prowling abroad And some are so theevishly disposed, that all the sommer long, when abundance of hony is every where [cw: to]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

to be had for a little labour, they will yet be filching though they dy for it. \25 *In the spring more earnest./*/ At the spring, specially in *Aries,/* they are more earnest, and therfore you must then have an eie unto them. Those stalles that have lost their Queene, or doe dislike their standing for coldnesse, moistnes, mustines, bleetness, or unsavourinesse, as taking no pleasure in their lives, doe easily suffer themselves to be robbed in the spring. And if none wil come to rob them, then on some faire daie they wil away together, sometime leaving both hony and yong ones behind them. \16 *The most spoil is made in Virgo./*/ But in *Virgo/* is the most dangerous time of all. Then shall all the stalles in your garden bee tried, whether they be such as will yeeld or no. And *Libra/* would not be much better, but that the most spoil is done before. \27 *What stals are most subject to robbing/*/ Little & poor swarms are much subject to robbing: likwise those Bees that are offended with the blacknesse and rottennesse of their combes, caused through age or wet, or with abundance of noisome stopping: wil most of them goe forth in the swarmes, leaving a very few, sometime not past a handful in the stocke: which yet in robbing-time wil keep the dore, as though the hive were full: but the robbers finding their weaknes wil surely spoile them, if they be not prevented. How to knowe such Bees, & what to do to them, see *c./*3.*n./*43. 
\28 *The robbers are the lustiest stalles./*/ The robbers are thought to be poore swarms and stockes, which have not sufficiently provi- [cw:ded][I]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

\Nat.hist.l.II.c.17/ ded themselves for winter: of which opinion was *Plini/* where he said. *Quod si defecerit aliciuis alvei cibus, impetum in proximas faciunt rapinæ proposito/*. but indeed such are fitter to be robbed, as before is said, then to be robbers. There is no thiefe to the rich thiefe: who although he have enough and more then enough, yet by hooke or by crooke he will have more, though the poore starve for it. 
\29 *How they begin the fray/*/ At the beginning of *Virgo/* the fat and full stalles doe send forth some of their stoutest yo?kers to spie and give the onset which going about from hive to hive so far as their walke extendeth, doe prove al. Where they have once sped, at their returne they bring more of the their company, until in the end that whole stall bee made acquainted with it. Sometime it happenneth that though there be an hundred stalles within a walke, yet the robbery is done altogether by one, sometime by two or three, al the rest being quiet. \30 *Theeves of divers hives agree together in robbing/*/ And this one thing is strange, that whereas no Bees wil abide strangers in their hives with them, yet theeves wil suffer on another & agree altogether in stealing, though they be of divers hives.
\31 *The description of the Bees battaile/*/ When the theeves having first made an entrie begin to come thicke, and the true Bees perceive themselves to be assaulted by many, they suddainely make an outcrie: and issuing out of their holds by troopes presently prepare [them-]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

themselves to battaile. some keepe the gates: some as skout watches fly about: some runne in againe to see what is done there: some begin to bussel with the enimie: and that with such a noise and dinne, as if the drum did sound an alarme. \32 *In the battaile is heard a sound like a drum and a flute./*/ Besides which base sound you shal eftsoones, in the heate of battaile, heare a more shril and sharpe note, as it were of a flute. 
*....&vox/*
*Auditur fractos conitus imitata tubarum./*
Which I am out of doubt is tuned by their generall commander, encouraging them to fight for their Prince, their lives, and their goods. \33 *The assault of the enimy/*/ Then shal you see the enimies bestirre themselves most venterously: some violently through the thickest thrusting in at the gates, others scaling the wals, and tearing them downe. If they once make a breach, without present succor, you shal quickly have an end to that fight. \34 *The defence of the beseeged./*/ One the other side, the defendants wil behave themselves as bravely, not giving any rest to the enimie part encountring with them that are without, part with them that have broken in: whome in a while they drawe out by the heeles, some dead and some alive. Likewise without you may see some slaine forthright with the thrust of the speare: some so deadly wounded, that they are not able to goe three foot from the place & some more lightly stroken, presently to loose the use of their wings, & [cw: for] [l2]

for a while to leap up and downe, forward and backward, like mad things. 
How long they live after they are hurt see. *c./*I.*n./*21.
\35 *Neither side willing to yeeld./*/ So loath are these courageous warriers to yeeld on either side, until there be no remedie. 
*Ingentes animos augusto in pectore versant
Usque adeo obnixi non cedere, dum gravis aut hos,
Aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga coegit./*
In their fight they are so furious sometime, and so thick about the garden, that unles you have your complet harnes, *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*38/ you may not dare to come nigh them.
\36 *The exercise of the the defendants when the enimy receiveth/*/ This also I have noted, that when the robbers are so few, that smal resistance wil serve, yet being called forth they wil not be idle: for you shall see some of them running up and downe about the hive, to seeke and search if any more come: others like trained souldiers, pracrising to fight, here one wrestling with another in single combat, there 2 or 3 or 4 setting against one, as their usual maner is to deal with the theevs. If you would knowe whether this fight bee in jest or earnest, with fellowes or with foes, the maner and the end thereof will shew you. For if they be fellows, their fight is not so fierce, & they wil part quietly as friends: whereas if they bee foes, though they scape, it shall bee with much adoe. For if the true men cannot kill the theeves, yet wil they hold them by the legges [cw: or] 

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

or by the winges so long as they can, in hope to have help, though they be drawne after. More over the yong souldiers which have scarce bin abroad before, you shal see the elder sort goe rounde about them, smoothing and trimming them in every place, as if they did addresse, and hearten them to fight. 
\37 *The waspes like vultures./*/ During the time of this battail, as afterward, the waspes like vultures pray upon the dead carcases, arrying them away peece-meale, *v./* \*v.n./*12/
\38 *The battaile ended they bury their dead./*/ The battaile being ended by repulse of the enimie, those corpses, which the waspes have least, they honestly bury as far from the hives as they can beare them. \*Virg./*/
*Tum corpora luce carentum
Ex portant tectis, & tristia funeræ ducunt./*
And then they draw together at the city-gates and there they buze one to an other, as if in their language they did talke of the fight, and commend one an other for their fortitude. 
\39 *The second assault of the enimy./*/ The robbers, prevailing not that day, wil up the next day so soone as it is light, an howre before the Bees use to come abroad: & then doe they make a fresh assault. The Bees finding the enimie among them, are presently up in armes: and so beginnes the seconde skirmish, which, without the taking of the citty or the overthrow of the assailants (which seldome hapneth) continueth, until very darknes part them.
When the true Bees finding themselves o- [cw: ver] [I3]

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

\40 *When the true Bees yeeld, they go with the conquerors/*/ vermacht with multitude, see there is no remedie, and that no resistance wil serve; at length they yeeld, and suffer the conquerours quietlie to spoile their goods. And after a while, when, by being togither in the same hive and sucking the same hony, al smel slike; they wil joine with their enimies, and help cary away their owne goods, and so become friends & live togither. At night they lodge with them: but in the daytime they returne with their newe fellowes to fetch that is leaft behinde. And when they have done, it is marvaile but, being encouraged by this victory, they set upon some other stall neer adjoining: and so is your whole garden in danger. 
\41 *Remedies./*/ Seeing therefore in so cruel and continuing a fight ofttimes the enimies are conquerours, and then al is lost; and if they be vanquisht, yet this victory is not without losse of men and goods, which the enimy ever nowe and then shifteth away: I knowe your desire is to knowe how to succour the true men, either by preventing this dangerous conflict, or by rescuing them in the same. \42 *To prevent robbing./*/ For the first read *c./*3.*n./* 36,37,38,&39. For the other many practises have been tired: some cast dust, some drinke, among them: \43 *And to stay it if you find it in time./*/ the one whereof doth no good, the other harm. For drink maketh them to smel al alike, so that the true men cannot knowe the theeves from their fellowes and therefore some use to do so [cw: when]

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

when two swarmes are put togither, that they may seeme to be of one company. If these usual helps be no helps, what help is there then? If you perceive their fighting in time before my great harme be done, then this must you do. First stop them up close that none can passe ether in or out, leaving only a breathing place. Then shal you have a double conflict, one within, an other without. The theeves that are with in, having no way to escape with their prayes, first or last wil be slaine al. They that are without, after a little wrestling, seeing nothing to be had but blows, wil not long abide this bootles danger. When you perceive the siege to be raised, and that there is litle or no fighting without (which wil be about an howre after) then may you let out your Bees, making the dore half an inch high, & scarce half an inch wide. Those fewe that were within will they bring forth to burial, some then, some on the morrow. In the evening, when the Bees are al In, shut them up as before. The next day betimes, before the Bees would bee abroad, must you looke for some of them againe. When they are come, beat them away with a bough, but kil them not: for so may you do your neighbour a shrewd turne, and your selfe too. 
But let not the Bees out before noone: and then make the dore so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once. So will the Bees keepe the [cw: robbers] [I4] 

=== 

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

robbers out, and followe their busines neverthelesse. The nexte day you may let them out rather: and if the dore be so narrow that it hinder their passage, you may make it wider. If this do not suffice, but stil the strange Bees wil strive to get in; assure your selfe that stall hath but a few Bees, and is not in case to be kept. And therefore if you be loth to take it now, because of the schadons that may corrupt the honie, then you must looke unto him carefully; least by little and little it come to little or nothing. 
\44 *When it is too late, and what is then to be done./*/ But if the Bees have yeelded before you are aware of it, so that the theeves rob quietly with out resistance; or the stall be much spoiled and the hony-cels broken (which you may perceive by the crumbs of waxe upon the stoole) then having shut the hive close assone as you can, the next evening or morning take that is leaft: otherwise in the end you shal loose all. For the Bees thereabout smelling the hony when the combs are broken, wil have it or die for it. 
This fierce and cruell robbing being alwaies in harvest, when people are busie in the fields, many hives are least honylesse, and they never the wiser. Wherefore it is good to leave some body at home, as well to watch these as the two legged robbers. 
\45 *In what yeeres robbing is most rife/*/ After a moist spring when swarmes are most plentiful, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*5/ robbing is most rife otherwise there is lesse danger. [cw: Be-]

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$ 

\46 *Bees kill poore swarms that wander in the spring/*/ Besides those Bees that are thuis spoyled in robbing, many also are killed by other stalles when they come to them for succour. For in the spring those swarmes that were lateward, or have beene halfe robbed, when they have spent al their store, the next warme day after away they fly: some to a tree where they hang til they deade, some adventure into other hives, where if they have large entrance, that they may throng in sodainly, sometime they scape with the death of some few, and being mingled togither continue with them as one stal: but for the most part they die every each one, *v/*. \*V./*c.I.*n/*20./ 
\47 *To prevent the death of poore swarms/*/ To prevent this losse, (1) when you percieve them to wax light and weake, drive them into a stalle that hath provision enough, *v./* (2) if it be your happe to see them entring a stal that is wel stored, lift up the hive and let them in togither: and (3) if you finde any hanging abroad, you may put them into what shal you list. By rearing the stal before a handful from the stoole, and laying the Bees upon the table, *v./* \*V.c./* 10.*par: I.n/* 9./ close to the dore. 
\48 14 *The weather/*/ Next unto the Bees the greatest enimy that the Bees have is unkinde weather: whereby at all times of the yeere both they and their fruits are much empaired.
\49 *In summer heat hurteth the Bees./*/ In sommer extreame heate melteth the combes specially of swarmes, and so sheddeth [cw: the]

the hony, if the hives be not shaded, and wel haccled. It also causeth the Bees to lie out, and so hindereth their swarming, *v./* \*v.c/*5*n./*19./ 
\50 *In winter the sun shine in frost & snow/*/ At winter, the sun shining in frosty or snowie weather is dangerous to the Bees. For the sun tilleth them abroad, and the frost chilleth them: many as they fly, that they canot returne: and many that returne, while they rest on the ground before the hive: but the snow amazeth them, & causeth them presently to fall & rise no more. 
\51 *Also the easterne winds and great frosts/*/ Also the freezing Easterne windes, & all great frosts kil many in the hives that be open, or uncovered: and therefore at such times it is good to shut them up close, *v./*  \*v.c./*3.*n./*53./ and to see them well hacled, *v.c./*3.*n./*16.
\52 *And the cold continued maketh them sicke./*/ And if the cold continuing keep them long in, it maketh them so sicke, heavy, and chillie; that many die assone as they come abroad into the aire, unlesse it be very pleasant, *v.c./*3.*n./*53.
\53 *The raine rotteth the hives./*/ Also the raine doth ofttimes soake into the hives and so corrupteth the combs and killeth the Bees: specially where the company is smal, not having heat enough to drie them againe. 
\54 *The remedy./*/ Wherefore provide thay alwaies your hacles be good. And for remedie (if any such chance happen) pul of the hacles in warme daies, that the sun may dry them: and in the 3 dead months *Sagit. Capr.& Aquar./* because the sun is then of smale force, drie the wicker hives with fire of straw: but then you must be sure they be [close]

\55. *the greatest losse by weather is in the spring for then infinit multitudes are beaten downe laden and wearie with storms and winde./*/ But the greatest losse is in the spring. For the Bees, specially the yong frie, being laded and wearie with their labour, some at their worke, some in the way home, some at the hive-dore are beaten downe, not only through soddaine stormes, but also through cold rough windes: and then unlesse the sun shine, or the wind ly, they never come home againe: in so much that sometime you may see the lanes *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n/*47.56/ strewed with them.
\56 *At the rising of a clowd they post home/*/ And therefore, when being a field they see a stormie or rainy clowd arising, presently they high them home for life: tumbling to the hive as thick as haile, thrunging, & throwing down one another before the dore for hast. Where if the cold raine catch them before they can recover the hive, they are in no better case then those that the storme beat down by the way: although when they are fresh and light, they wil fly abroad in the midst of a warm shower, not caring for it.
\57 *Yet wil they goe afield in the midst of a warme shower./*/ They which are thus taken abroad must take their chance: but if you defend your Bee-garden as you ought, *v./* \*v.c./*2.*n./*2.4&5./ you shall prevent the fall of many at home. And those that you find chilled with cold, though they be quite dead, without sense, motion, and breth, yea and have laien so al the day; you may if you be disposed [cw:re-]

revive with the warmth of your hand, so that it will seeme a miracle unto you. For presently (their spirit returning) you shal see them begin to pant and breath againe, and anone they will fly away as lustie as the best. 
\59 *The wind causeth many to be drowned./*/ Also where palme-withies, or other trees whereon they gather, do hang over the water; the rough windes throw: downe and drowne a number of them. Wherefore if you have any such trees, in any wise let them not stand. *Tot hostibus tot casibus tam mumificum animal expositum est/*

##*Of the removing of Bees./*/##
##CHAP. 8/## 

\*Remove Bees in a faire day/*/ {R}Emove your Bees alwaies in a faire day, and as neer as you can gesse in setled weather. For when they are moved to another place, if it be within their circuit or walke, they will fly to their old standing as soon as they are let goe, and hanker about it sometime six or seaven daies: where if the cold wet catch them, many loose their lives. And if you remove them out of their knowledge, then, as amazed in an uncouth place, they fly about for a while viewing the country, and searching for their old home: when they are weary, they rest wheresoever: and if foule weather come upon them, they are in like danger. 
\2. *Not in sommer/*/ It is not good to remove Bees in sommer for letting their Work in the chiefest hony-gathering. 
\3. *Nor in winter/*/ And it is worse in winter, for loosing the Bees. For if fowle weather fall not, the very stil cold wil kil many, while they are straying abroad: and of those that returne, being not yet [cw: ac-]

acquainted with the hive-dore, some will fal short, some upon the hive: where, while they rest panting, the cold chilleth them. 
\4 *The fittest time in the autumne & spring./*/ The fittest time is either in *Libra/* & the fore-part of *Scorpio/*, that they may thoroughly know their new standing before the weather be too cold; or in *Aries/* & the later part of *Pisces,/* that they may bee acquainted with it before any great gathering of hony. 
Neverthelesse if you have Bees in other mens keeping, whose care and skil you mistrust, you were better to remove them in sommer before *Virgo/* for feare of robbing; or in winter for feare of mise & other evils, then to hazard al by their ignorance and negligence.
\5 *Libra the best month in all the yeare./*/ But if you may choose, remove in *Libra/* only, which is simply the best.
\6*The time of the day and manner of removing./*/ In the evening, when you meane to remove an howre before sunset prop up the hive from the stoole with three bolsters two or three inches thicke, that the Bees may ascend from the stoole: about halfe an howre after, having prepared an other stoole of the same highth & of sufficient breadth, and having covered it with your mantle so that the middle of the mantle be over the middle of the stoole; move the stall with his stoole, if you may, a little aside, and set this covered stoole in his place: or if it cannot wel be moved, then set the covered stoole close to the old stoole either beside it, or before it [cw: this]

$*Of the removing of Bees./*/$

This done, lift up the stal from his old stoole & set it upon the new: and then wiping the Bees from the old stoole (if any remaine) with your brush, ether take the stoole away, or cover it with a cloath: and then if your new stoole be only a planke without legs borne up by some other meanes, it is good to set it upon the old. Within a while when the Bees are all in, knit the mantle at the fowre corners over the top of the hive so as the knots may not slip, and presently binde it to the hive about the middle slackly with a smal line, and wrest it fast with a little sticke. And so is the stall ready to be removed.
\7 *The usuall manner of removing/*/ They use commonly to make no more ado, but after sunset when the Bees are at rest to lift up the stal and set it upon a mantle spreade on the ground, and so to binde them up, leaving the Bees upon the stoole (which in a good stall are not a few) behinde them. \8 *Whic is fit for poore stalles./*/ Which way, for such stals as have al their Bees up in the hive, may serve wel enough.
\9. *How a good stall is to be carried./*/ The best way to carry your stal is upon a cowl-staffe betweene two, and rather with the top downward then upward. If it be light, one may carry it in his hand. But howsoever, be sure it hang perpendicularly for feare of breaking the combs, specially if you chance to remove before *Libra/*, \10 *How a bad/*/ when the waxe is soft and the lower partes of the combs are heavy with [cw: yong]

yong Bees. 
\11 *What to doe when they are brought home/*/ When you have brought the stal home, you may let it stande bound, as it is, al night in the house. The morrow when the weather serveth, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n/*58/ set him on his seat: and then having loosed the line, & taken away the mantle, cloome him up presently leaving for three or fowre daies a very narrow entrance for feare of robbing. \12 *And what when they are seated./*/ For their new neighbours wil try not to stoutly resist, until they be acquainted in the place.
