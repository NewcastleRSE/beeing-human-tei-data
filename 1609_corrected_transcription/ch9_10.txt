##*Of the feeding of Bees./*/##
##CHAP. 9/##

\*What Bees are to be fed/*/ {B}Lackberrie-swarmes, which by reason of their latwardnesse have not gathered provision enough to bring about the yeere, with third & fourth swarmes, if anie be, which are smale and weake, and others also which through your negligence the robbers have least in the same case, must have some help at your hands if you mean to keep them. As for stockes that have not gotten sufficient stockes, or being once gotten, have lost them againe; there is no hope that they will thrive, & therefore take no paines about them.
\2 *When they cease to lay up in store./*/ At *Virgo/* the Bees cease to lay up hony: yet all that month they wast not their store, unles they be robbed, but live of their daily labour from hand to mouth. In *Libra/* likewise they spend little or nothing.
\3 *When and how long they spend on the stock./*/ But in *Scorpio/* & *Pisces/* their gathering is little in the three months betweene them nothing at all. In *Aries/* & *Taurus/* the plants yeeld then more plentie of food of both sorts: but then [cw: they] [K]

\Wet, cold, and windy/ they have more companie to spend it, and unkind weather oftentimes suffereth them not to goe forth for it. So that all this while they live upon the stocke: yea the weaker stals somewhat longer, as being not so wel able to abide the cold aire. And therefore for want of wome store to feed on between whiles at home, I have knowne some die after mid-*gemini/*
\4 *Some are stored for a longer time, some for a lesse./*/ Of which seaven months some have provision only for six, some but for foure or five: and some also not for so long a time: which you may well joine with the unthriftie stockes. *v./* \*v.n./*1/ for they are not worth the feeding. 
\5 *The usual time of feeding./*/ When men perceive by the lightnesse of the hives that they wax leene and honiles, they begin to feed, some about *Pisces/*, some sooner, some later, giving to each one everie morning, before other Bees are abroad, a spoonful of hony: and so they continue until *Gemini/*, if the weather be then warme; otherwise somewhat longer, without intermission. For the Bees will duly looke for it, and languish if they lacke it. 
\6 *The usual maner of feeding/*/ Some give it them in a spoone: but that way many of them besmeare their wings, & if their fellowes licke them not cleane presently before the cold chill them, they die. Others, to avoid this inconvenience, give it to them in a tost, which being warme drinketh in the hony, whence they draw it out with their tonges: but this waie wasteth hony, and doth not al- [cw: to-]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

together avoid the former inconvenience. Others have other devises: but indeed the only good waie is to give it them in a piec of acomb *v./* \*v.n./*19./ If you use to knock the hive, when you put in the hony; they wil come down as duly as sheep to a cal, when they are to be fodered. 
\7 *This late feeding often fayleth/*/ This feeding of Bees is altogether condemned by some as paineful and fruitlesse, saying if you feed them not, they can but die: and soe wil they doe when you have bestowed your labour and cost. \8 *Yes it may save such as have some store./*/ Indeed many of them, that are thus fed, do, miscarrie: but if the hony be good, and duely given them before their store be al spent, for the most part they live: the sommer following they provide sufficiently for winters, & the next they are likely to swarme and grow fat.
\9 *How to save those that have no store in the spring/*/ But if any of your stalled, at any time in the spring, be so neere driven that they have spent all (which you may know by their lightnesse and lothnesse to come abroad, when others are busie) then because feeding in such a case doth seldome say, if you will save their lives, drive them into a stall that is fat, and they wil agree and cast the soone: the manner of driving see  *c./*10.*part./*1.*n./*20. 
\10 *How to feed Bees without hony./*/ For want of hony many other things have been used insteed thereof. *Aristotle/* mentioneth figges, and all such sweet things. *Apiarii ficus ac reliqua ad genus dulcia cibum apponnut./* \Hist.li.9.c.40/ and *Plin/* speaking more particularly commen- [cw: deth] [K3]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

deth raisings, and figges, and teased wool wet with meth, or honi-water, or sweete wine made of raisings, or new wine boiled. \Nat hist. l. 21. c. 14./ *Si cibus deesse censeatur apibus, vuas passas siccasue, sicosque, tusas ad fores earum posuisse conveniet: item lanas tractas madentes passo aut defrunto, aut aqua mulsa./* And some of our country-men have practised to give them bay salt, and beane flower, and sweet wort. Al which things though they will be spend, yet cannot the Bees be preseved by then without hony. 

Touching the councell of *Plinie./* this is to bee noted, that if you place their food *ad fores/* before the dore, it wil draw strange Bees unto them: whereby the hives of the one, and the goods of the other wilbe endangered: if you place it abroad from your hive, then wil it bee common: and if within upon the stooke, which is best, then must you remove it in time, *v.n./*16 otherside it will be no better for them if it were set *ad fores/*. And as for the devise of teased wool, it is a fitter meanes to catch Bees then to seede them: for if the liquor bee above the wool, it will lime the winges of many; if not, many wilbe entangled in the smale haires as birds in a grinne. Cover it therefore with a linnen cloath so that the Bees may not creepe betweene. 

\11 *The best time of feeding./*/ But it is far better to feed the Bees before they need (that they may save their store which they have shut up in their celles until the spring) namely in *Scorpio,/* when otherwise they would [cw: begin] 

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

begin to spend on the stock. And not before, lest it be taken from them; nor yet when it is colder then they can endure, lest in seeking to save their lives you cause their deaths, either within as they are feeding, or without when they are gon for water, which at such time they can not want. 
\12 *The benefit of rathe feeding/*/ Halfe the hony that they spend in the spring, as they are commonly fed, wil serve them at this time, and doe them twise so much goof. For those that have spent their own store, and have litle or nothing leaft at the end of winter, ar so discouraged & so feeble with fasting, that knowing their thin bodies can beare out no cold, they wil not come abroad but when they are fed, and then only to fetch water, unles the weather be exceeding warm & calme: & the more they keepe in, the weaker still they are. But those whose rather feeding hath caused them to spare their store till the spring, will bee as cheerefull as the best: in any reasonable weather they wil abroad, and fetch in that fruitfull *Ambrosia,/* which causeth them presently to breed. *v.c./*4.*n./*11.
\13 *Bees are to be fed according to their want./*/ The poore swarmes are to be fed much of little, longer or lesse while, according to their want. What each swarme wanteth cannot certainely be knowne: neverthelesse, through some direction together with experience, you [cw:may] [K3]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

may guesse neere the matter, alwaies observing this rule, that it is safer to offend in the excesse, then in the defect: although what wanteth at this time, may be supplied in *Pisces/* following. *v.n./*17
\14 *What propotion of hony to the Bees in requisit/*/ Halfe the same quantity of hony that is of Bees wil keepe them al the winter. And therefore a gawne of hony wil serve a pecke of Bees without feeding. And a pottle will serve so many from *Pisces/* forward. So that such a stal having but a pottel, needeth an other pottel to be given them in *Scorpio,/* to feed them til *Pisces./* And so proportionably of the rest. You may also conjecture, when you have fed them, whether they have sufficient, by comparing them in weight with other swarmes that are well provided. 
\15 *The best manner of feeding./*/ The best way to feed Bees is this. First take an emptie combe, and powre thereon so much hony as it may receive: if you thinke it be not liquid enough, then either warme it first in a pot over the fire, or else spread it all over the combe with your knife, that it may sinke into the cels: for which purpose live-hony is the best. \16 *The fittest time of the day for it is the evening./*/ The honies combe place upon a treene platter, or holow round bord almost of the compasse of the hive within: & then in a faire calme evening when the heate of the day and of the Bees worke is past, put it upon the stoole, & so set downe the hive over it. Then wil those Bees [cw: to] 

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

to worke a fresh, being out of danger of other Bees which then begin to rest their wearyed limbs. And in the morning they wil at it again betimes with al possible speed, that they may have made cleane worke before the heat of the day: by which time the bordering Bees, being rife abroad, wilbe ready to rifle them if they once resent the hony. And therefore to that time, whether the comb be rid or no, take it away, and close up the hive. The next evening (if the weather sit) dresse it so againe, not ceasing until you have given them so much as will suffice. This hony, when they have first taken their refection, they convey into their voide cels: which because they cannot nowe shut up (as before *Virgo/*) for want of waxe, *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*13/ they do but halfe-fil. And therfore they first spend of it, reserving that which was more safely laide up until the last. 
If insteed of this combe thus dressed you wil take a ful honi-combe, then first open the cels with your knife: otherwise they wil not convey it, but wil cover and keepe it as their own combs til the weather wax cold, & then they forsake it and suffer it to spil. 
\17 *The second feeding time/*/ At *Pisces,/* if you feare they will lacke, (which you may perceive by their lightnes) doe like-wise, and supply their want: but then it is best to give them their food in a morning, leaste colde and darknes overtake them, whiles greedy hun [cw:ger] [K4]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

ger maks them stay to long: & so to let it stand until they have conveied it. For in that month there is no great feare of robbing. 
\18 *The third time of feeding if need be./*/ And if having omitted to feed them sufficiently at these due times, you thinke it necessary to give them somewhat in *Aries/* or after, when the wether is warme againe, let it be done in the evening as before in *Scorpio./*
\19 *A general caveat./*/ But alwaies bee sure, assone as the combe is laid, that the hive be made close, with no greater entrance then must needs be: lest the borderers smelling the booty breake in, not without danger to the stal, and death to manie of themselves.

*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*

CHAP. 10/##
{W}Herein is shewed first the vindemiation or taking of the combes: secondly the trying of the *Waxe & Honie/*, with the making of *Meth/*:& thirdly the singular vertues of them, for the use and comfort of man. 

*The first part of this Chapter sheweth the taking of the combes./*
\1 *The first kind of vindemiation/*/ THE ordinary taking of the combes is by killing the Bees. For which the fittest time is in *Libra/*: because til then the combs ar ful of schadons, which deceive the honi-men, making the hive heavier and the hony worse: for the young Bees as well as the stopping corrupt the same. \2. *The best time of killing Bees./*/ *Pulli & rubra sordes sunt mals saporis, & succi suo mella corrumpunt./* \Col.l.9 c.15/ Neither do the Bees any whit diminish the hony in their hives until the end of this month, unlesse much fowle weather keepe them long in before. But if you see them in danger of robbing, rather then loose al, take them sooner, and picke out the grubs as [cw: wel]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

wel as you may. 
\3 *What stalles are to be taken/*/ At this time therefore consider with your selfe what stals you wil kill. Swarmes that maie live, yeerlings, & two-yeerlings, you must keep for store. Those that have stood three or fowre yeeres, and, by reason of their not swarming the last sommer, are ful of Bees, lightly are very fat, and therefore worth the taking: but they are also good for store. But if they have cast twice that sommer (unlesse they were very forwarde & had to beat away their drones by *S. James/*-tide) then are they not likely to continue, and thereofre are to be taken. \*v.c./*9.*n./*1./ Likewise al poore *v./* swarms, unlesse you meane to helpe them. Nether is it safe to trust any, after they have stoode five yeeres. 
\4 *The manner of killing Bees/*/ Having made choice of your stals to be killed, thus must you do. Earely in a morning before any Bees be abroad, or in an evening when al are come in, first digge a hoale in the groun as neere the stoole as may be, about six inches deepe and almost as wide as the hive-skirtes. Then having a litle sticke whose length is more then the semi-diameter of the pit, out a brimstone-match in the one end being slit, and the other end beeing shript sticke into the side of the hoale, so that the match may lande tight in the midle. This match is to be made of a linnen rag, wound in a fashion of a candle, & dipt in melted brinstone, after the maner that [cw: maides]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

maides amke sluts. When you have fired this at the upper end, set over the hive and presentlie shut it so close at the skirtes, that none of the smoake maie come forth. So shal you have them al dead in lesse then a quarter of an howre. 
\5 *Sundrie meanes to kill Bees./*/ Next unto the brimstone is the smoake of tuchwood, or puckfists used in like manner: but they are neither so quicke nor so sweete. And for a need some smother them with danke straw or hay: but then the hony wil smel of the smoake. And therfore some for want of brimstone, tuch-wood or puckfists, will drowne them in a tub of water: but that hurteth the hony, & doth the hive no good: and besides that, many of the Bees being not quite dead wil sting them that handle the hony. Therefore he that hath Bees must not lacke those forsaid necessaries. 
\6 *How to take the combes when the Bees are dead/*/ The Bees being dead, squat the hive softly against the grounf upon his sides: and then having loosed the ends of al the spleets, you maie easily take out the combes togither. 
\7 *Bees not to be killed when some are abroad./*/ Some careles honi-men will take your Bees at any time of the daie, when many of them are abroad: the which at their returne finding all gone, presentlie invade the next. And some wil carry away the Bees alive, and either willingly or against their wils let many out: which returning home will likewise trouble the next stals, and having begin sil set others a worke. It behoveth you therefore to prevent this danger, if [cw: you]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

you may. But if at any time you be thus served, the Bees will first come to the stoole where they stood, and settle there: where, if you attend a while, you maie kil most of them.
\8 *The second kind of vindemiation./*/ An other way to take the combes is by driving the Bees. The maner of it is this. At Mid-sommer, or wihin two or three daies after, in a faire morning an hower before sunrising, lift the stalle from the stoole, and set it upright & fast on the ground by some staies \9 *The time & maner of driving Bees./*/ with the bottome upward & then quickle set on the emptie hive, having first layed two spleetes upon the full hives bottome, that the emptie hive may stand the faster. And so wrapping a Mantle round about the chinke or meeting of both the hives, and binding it fast with a smale cord above and beneath, that a Bee may not get forth, knock the ful hive round about a good many times, pawsing now and then a little betweene, that the Bees may ascend into the void hive. And when you thinke that most of them are driven up (which wilbe about half an houre after) set the upper hive upon the old stoole, & knock the Bees that remaine, out of the nether hive upon a tablet two or three foot square, set close to the forpart of the old stool, that thence they may walke into their new home. When so you have got forth as many as you can, carry the hive away from place to place every now & [cw: then] 

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

then knocking the same. 
\10 *How to take the combs/*/ They which in the meane pace fly out, wil go to their fellowes. After a while, either without your garden or in the most remote part thereof, squat the hive a little on every side: and then, having loosed the spleetes ends, take out the combs one after another and wiping the Bees, that yet remaine, from each comb into a kever or other like vessel, send the combes as fast as you have wiped them into the house. And when you have done, set the kever and the emptie hive before the stoole: and in a while the Bees wil goe al together, and gather up cleane that little hony that is leaft. 
Provided alwaies, before you goe about this busines, that al the stalles in your garden bee first shut up, least they trouble you, and your poore Bees.
\11 *This driving of Bees unprofitable/*/ This kind of taking is much applauded at the first, because men thinke thereby to save both Bees, and hony. But it ofttimes falleth out with them, as it is in the proverb, *All comet all loose./* For the hony is neither so good, as being not yet in season, and to bee corrupted with the schadons, *v./* \*v.n./*2/ which can hardly bee cleane taken from it: neither so much by almost the one halfe, sith there remaine yet six of seaven weeks of the chiefest honi-gathering [cw: And]\12 *The hony taken is little & naught/*/

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

\13 *And the Bees driven fewe and poore./*/ And the Bees, as men forcibly driven from their goods and children, are so discouraged; that they seldome trhive after it: specially those that have swarmed, seeing their company is least but mal, and the after-brood is destroied, which should have supplied the roomes of them that are gone. And as for those that have not cast they might after that time yeeld a swarm, which would be better then the whole stal being driven: and if they did not swarme at al, then would they be so much the bettyer, either to take for hony or to keepe for store. 
The next yeere, if the stormy colde spring make not much spoile among them (for in such weather the best stals, as most bold, loose most of their company) they wil be sure to cast one very good swarme, if not two, and, when they have done, to yeeld good store of honie. 
\14 *An other kind of driving/*/ This driving of Bees into leere hive being nothing so profitable as it seemeth, I doe rather commend unto you the driving of one stal into another: whereby the fruit of one is taken and the lives of both are saved together. 
\15 *At 2 times/*/ And thus some are to be driven in *Libra,/* or rather in *Scorpio,/* because then other Bees will not be so busie and some in *Aquarius/* or *Pisces,/* before they begin to breed. 
\16 *Driving in Libra/*/ In *Libra/* such stalles onely are to be driven, as are fit to bee killed. *v./* and that into yeerelings or two-yeerelings, which that yeere have [cw: cast]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

castwise, and therefore have few Bees least in them; or into after-swarms, which have half-filled their hives with combes, and not much more: for if they have wrought them downe within a handfull of the stoole, they are sufficient in themselves. 
\17 *The manner of driving in Libra/*/ The maner of it is this. First move these two stalles, the *stranger/* that is driven, and the *receiver,/* as neere as may be one to another: & so let them stand together six or seaven daies, til they be well acquainted with their standings: and then, the weather being faire and constant, late in the evening, about ten or eleven a clock, set the stranger fast on the ground with his bottome upward, and the receiver upon him, & binde them close together as in the former driving. And then, by often clapping the stranger between your hands about the space of a quarter of an howre, now and then pausing betweene, having driven most of the Bees to the reciever, and so mingled them altogether, let them so stand til the morning. In the morning, an houre before sun rising if the weather be faire, otherwise you must stay longer, doe the like. This done, set the receiver upon the strangers stoole (but be sure to boister him up with three tilehsardes, that the driven Bees may easily get into the hive on every side) and then knock the stranger downe upon the table set before his stoole and by clapping of the [cw: hive]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

hive presently, get as many of the Bees forth as you can. And forthwith cary the hive away from place to place & every when you be come to a newe place, and there have knocked out some Bees, leave there the stranger, and go directly to the receiver, and a little beyond: for the Bees wil follow you, and thereby the sooner recover the hive. When by this means you have wel nigh rid the stranger of his Bees, begin to take out the combs, proceeding as in the former driving, Assone as you have done, and the Bees begin to be quiet, take away the bolsters, & cloome up the receiver very close, leaving the dore no wider then must needes bee. And when they are quiet, let out your other Bees. 
\18 *How to revive those that are chilled in driving./*/ If, the wether being not warme, you finde some Bees to be chilled about the hive; fil your warme hands ful of them, and anone they will fly away to their fellowes, *v/* \*V.c./*7.*n./*58/ and if happily any of them chance to pricke you (which they will seldome do) your hand wil have the more vertue to revive the rest.
\19. *How to help those driven Bees that want./*/ If you thinke there be not sufficient provision for this double stal in that single hive, bestow a ful combe or twaine, *v./* \*V.c./*9 *n./*16/ as neede requireth, of the strangers upon them: and thus wil your Bees delight and prosper in new waxe, which in olde corrupte combes woulde decay: [cw:In]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

\20 *driving in Pisces/*/ In *Aquarius./* or *Pisces,/* when you have poised your hives, those that you find by their lightnes unlikely to endure the spring for lacke of food, you may in like maner drive into such provided stalles, as have fewest Bees: and so wil those receivers be much the better, & cast both the rather and the greater swarmes. And if by chance at any time after, you find a stal decayed, thus may you save them. 
This driving wil not be so troublesome as the former, because the poore Bees wil easily change their hungry home for a place of plenty. 
\21 *A third kind of vindimiation/*/ Exection or castration is a third kind of taking: which is the cuting out of part of the combes, part of being least for the Bees provision. And this was to bee done at two times in the yeere, *In ortu & occasu virgiliarum/*.
\22 *Exection used at two time./*/ *Virgiliarum ortus/* after *Columel l.9.c./*14. is the 48 day from *æquinoctium vernum/*: after *Var./*: the 44. but then you must understand that they accounted the *æquinoctium/* to be in the 8 degree of *Aries/* (although *Hipparchus/*, as Col. saith, had then found it to be the first) With us the comicall rising of *Vergiliæ/* or *Pleiades/* being 7 starres in the neck of *Taurus/*, and in the 24 degree of that signe, is knowne to be in the 3 of May, the 55 day after the true *æquinoctium/*: which jumpeth with the account of *Columella./* And *Vergiliarum occasus/*, being in the same degree of the opposite signe, is upon the 5. day of Novemb.
\23 *What part to be exsacted is uncertaine./*/ But what part is to be taken, & what least, I find it not determined. *Priore messe/* (saith Co- [cw:lumella] [I]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

\l.9.c.15/ lumella *dum adhuc rura pastionibus abundant, quinta pars favorum; posteriore cum iam metuitur hyems, tertia relinquinda est./* But *Varro/* then requireth for their store two third parts; *ut ne plus tertia pars exacatur mellis, reliquum hyemationi relinquatur/*. And *Aristotle/* because (as Col. granteth) *hic modus non est in omnibus regionibus certus/*, doth not prescribe any certaine part, but leaving it to the discretion of the Bee-master, saith, *Cum favos apiarii eximunt, cibitantum relinquant, quantum per hymem sufficiat: quod si satis sit, servatur examen; sin minus, vel moritur ibidem (sive dicedat hyems abstet) vel de ferat sedem, si serenum nanciscitur./*
\24 *Exsection ancient, but not profitable. Neither first./*/ This way of taking, as appeareth, was anciently used in plentifill countries, as Greece, Scicilie, Italie, &c. But the former exsection, to wit in the spring, *Aristotle/* no where mentioneth: and surely it must needs doe more harme then good, seeing the hives are then full of schadons which being spild, spilleth their swarming; and the store of hony, which they seeke for, is then wel spent. 
\25 *Nor second/*/ And also in the autumne (which yet is the fitter time) seemeth no lesse unprofitable then troublesome; because the Bees in the spring following, if they lack not hony to live on, yet shal they lacke celles to lay their yong in, wher by their breed wilbe hindered. And at nether time can it be don without much spoil of bees. [cw: But]

\26 *Specially for our Country/*/ But howsoever it faied with them, for our country I take it to bee very unfitting. And therefore I say the lesse of it: referring the curious reader unto the fifteenth Chapter of the ninth booke of *Colum./* and unto *Georgius Pictorious/*, who in his fourteenth Chapter writeth thereof at large. 

*The second part of this Chapter sheweth the trying of hony and wax with the making of methe./*

\1. *The combes to be broken into 3 parts./*/ THE combs being taken forth break then presentlie, while they are warme, into three parts: the first cleane hony & wax: the second hony and wax without stopping: the third wax without hony. But that they maie breake right where you would have them, first marke them out with the edge of your knife. 
\2 *The dressing of the first part for hony/*/ The first part breake into a hair-sieve set over a pan, bowle, or other fast vessell that maie hold it (Cooper-ware wil leake though it bee wel jointed) and so let the live-hony, *v./* \*v.c./*6*n./*27./ run of it owne accord, so long as it wil: when it ceaseth running, breake the pieces and let them run againe: and lastly with a warme sharpe knife cut those pieces at hurt the cels, & so let them run the third time. If the weather bee not warme, set the hony by a fire to helpe the running. 
\3 *The first shoot is fine hony/*/ The first shoot put up apart for fine hony. *In/* [cw: *omni/*] [L2]

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

\4 *How to know good hony/*/ *omni melle que p se sluit ut mustum oleunque appellaturque acæton, maxime laudabile est/*. \Nat. hist. li. II.c.15/ Which you shall finde to have these properties: cleere, odoriferous, yelow like gold, (unlesse it be virgin hony, for that is more chrystalline) sharpe, sweet, & pleasant to the tast, of a mean consistence betweene thicke & thin, so clammy that beeing taken up upon your fingers ende, in falling it wil not part but hang downe togither like a long string, as that useth to do which is clarified. \L.I.de medicam.simp delectu./ And such doth *Jacobus Sylvius/* describe the best hony to be. *Meloptimus sit purum adeo ut totum perluceat, odorum, flavum, acerrimus, dulcissimumque gustanti & jucundissimum, consistentia nec crassam nec liquidam, sed tam sibi coharens ut continuitatem suam, quasi linea longissima, non intercisum servet, si digito attollitur idem coquendo paucam spumam emittit./* \5 *The best hony is the bottome./*/ But alwaies the best part of this best hony is that which is lowest in the vessell. For as the best oile is in the top, and the best wine in the middle; so the best hony is in the bottome. \Hist. an.l.9.c.40./ *Mellis exilior pars fluitat, quæ eximenda est: pura vero & valida subsidit./*
As among liquours oile excelleth in lightnes & hony in heavines; so in both, that part is Left which excelleth in his excelling qualitie: & wine being of a midling weight is best in the middle. The weight of these three one to another hath this proportion. Oile is not so heavy as wine by one tenth part: for if you fil a measure with wine and divide it into ten parts, the same measure of oile is no heavier then nine of them. And hony is heavier then wine [cw: by]

===

For when they have pounded it altogether, they hang it up in a thin hearen bagge, and thence let it run into a vessel, & some (which is worse) doe violently presse it out. But by these means they shal have no fine & pure raw hony, howsoever afterward they handle it.

And thus shall you loose none of your hony. 
\13 *How to know when it is strong enough/*/ If the liquor be not strong enough to beare an egge the breadth of a two-pence above it, then put so much of your course hony into it, as wil give it that strength: or rather, when it is so strong powre in more water (stirring it with the liquor) until the egge sinke. If any many thinke this to be too smale; it may be amended in the boiling: which (as anon is shewed) wil give it what strength you wil, and cleerenesse withal.

For if it once sink down againe, the liquor wil not be cleere without putting in some cold liquor to raise it.

(18) \2 *As well outwardly as inwardly received/*/ It raiseth humours to the upmost parts, and therefore is fitly laid to fowle ulcers: (19) it helpeth the griefes of the iawes, (20) the kernels growing within the mouth, (21) & the squinancie or inflammation of the muscle of the inner gargil, for which purple it is gardgarized, \*Stomache.

(26 It is also good for the falling sicknes, and better then wine, because it cannot arise to the head, as the wine doth. (27) Lastly it is a remedy against a surfet: for they that are skilful in physicke, when they perceive any mans stomach to bee overcome, they first ease it by vomit: & then, to settle his braine and to stay the noysome fume from ascending to his head, they give him honie upon bread.

\7 *Two waies to clarifie hony./*/ You may boile hony either by it selfe, or else with the like quantity of water, or other liquor. But alwaies in boiling skim it, that it may bee pure. By it selfe you must boile it untill it wil [cw: yeeld]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

yeeld no more skum. 
The right skum, which is drosse, is short and brittle: which when it is cleane taken awaie, the force of the fire wil cause the very hony to rise up like a skum, but that will then be tougher and more clammie then the drossie skum, and so wil al the rest be, when it is cold, as being over-boiled: therefore be sure to take it of in time. 
(which wil be about halfe an houre) and that with a very soft fire, or in a double vessel, lest, by over-heating, it get a bitter tast, and lest it soddainly run over and flame. 
With water it is to be boiled an houre at the least, even until the water be evaporated: which thing is knowne by the bubbles that rise from the bottom, & by the wasting of the one halfe: then, to make it more pure, put into every pound of hony the!!a/!! \!!a/!!Less white may serve if the hony be good./ white of one egge, and afterward skim it againe in the boiling. The fire may be more fervent at the first, but toward the end it must be slack: for it is then apt to be set on fire, as the meere hony, and to become bitter with violent heate. 
\8 *How to clarifie stone-hony./*/ If you will clarifie the stone-hony remaining in the combs, thus doe. When you have pared away as much of the wax as you may, breake the hony combes into a vessel to boile: and then powre faire water into it, until the water rise an inch or twaine above the bottome. When you have set this over the fire, stirre it together ever now and then: as soone as it is al melted and beginneth to boile, take it of and [cw: straine] 

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$ straine it, and then set it over a soft fire againe, & skim it cleane, unto the skum put faire warm water: when you have stirred it about, crush the wax together in your hand, and lay it aside: & the water (if you make no meth) either give it to your Bees, or, having boiled and skimmed it, put it to your brewlock. 
The course hony being boiled and clarified hath a most pleasant & delicate tast, & is comparable for most uses to the purest bottome-hony being raw. 
Which pure hony if you be disposed to boil it, wil aske lesse time to be clarified, as yeelding little or no skum at all, and in tast & vertue it is more excellent.
When your hony is boiled enough, take it from the fire, and rather too soone, and then too late: for if there be any drosse remaining, you shall find it in the top, when it is cold: but overmuch boiling consumeth the spiritous parts of the hony, and turneth. the sweet tast into bitter. 
\9 *The quintessence of hony/*/ And such is hony in his owne kind, both raw and boiled. It is also altered by distillation into a water. Which *Raimundus Lullius/* that excellent Chymist calleth the quintessence of hony. This quintessence dissolveth gold, & maketh it potable, & likewise any sort of pretious stone that is put therein.

if any be dying, and drink 2 or 3 drame therof, presently he wil revive. If you wash any wound therewith, or other fore; it wil heal quickly. It is also good against the cough, catarre, & paines of the melt, and against many other diseases. Being given for the space of 46 daies together to one that hath the palsie, it helpeth him. Which thing *John Hester/* a practical Chymist, in his key of Philosophie professeth himselfe to have proved. It helpeth also the falling sicknesse, and preserveth the body from putrifaction. Of so marvellous efficacie is this water. 
\11 *The making of it/*/ The making of is is after this manner. Take two pound of perfect pure hony and put it into a great glasse, that foure parts of five may remaine emptie: !!a/!!lute it wel with a head & receiver, and give it fire until there appeare certaine white fumes, which, by laying wet clothes on the receiver and head and changing them when they are warme, wil turne into a water of a red colour like blood. \!!a/!!The lute may be made of clay, flocks, & salt-water, tempered together or of meal and whites of egges./ When it is al distille, keepe the receaver close shut, and let it stand til it be cleere, and of the colour of a rubie.

Of the first sort are marmalade, and marchpane, preserved fruits, as plums, &cheries: &c. Conserves of roses, violets, &c. with syrups of the like matter. 
\13 *Marmalade made of hony/*/ Marmalade is thus made. First boile your quinces in their skins til they be soft, then having pared and strained them, mix therewith the like quantitie of clarified hony, and boile this togither til it be so thick, that in stirring (for you must continually stirre it for feare of burning) you may see the bottom, or being cooled on a trencher, it be thick enoug to slise: then take it up and box it speedily. \Fernel method l.7.de legmatis/ This is very good to comfort and strengthen the stomake. For want of quinces you may take wardens, peares, or aples, and specially the pear-maine, giliflower, pipim, and roial. 
\14 *Marchpane/*/ Marchpane may be made after this manner. Botle and clarifie by it selfe, so much hony as you think meet: when it is cold, take to every pound of hony the white of an egge, and beare them together and wax white, and when you have boiled it againe 2 or 3 walmes upon a fire of [cw: coles] [M2]

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

coles, continually stirring it, then put to it such quantity of almonds stamped as shall make it of a just consistence: and after a warme or two more, when it is wel mixt, powre it out uppon a table, and make up your marchpane. This is good for the consumption. 
\15 *Preserves/*/ *Preserve fruits after this manner./* 
The damascens, or other frui, being gathered fesh from the tree; faire, & in their prime; neither greene nor sower, nor over-ripe or sweet; with their stalkes, but cut short: weigh them, & take their weight in raw fine hony: putting to the hony the like quantity of faire water, boil it some halfe quarter of an howre, or til it will yeeld no skum: then having slit the damascens into the dented side for feare of breaking, boile them in this liquor til the meate commeth clean from the stone, & then take them up. If the liquor be then to thin, boile it more: if in the boiling it be to thick,put in more faire water, or rose-water if you like it. The liquor being  a fit consistence, lay up and preserve therein your fruits. 
\16 *Conserves/*/ Conserves of Roses is thus to be made.

\17 *Syrups. Syrup of roses/*/ After the same maner is made conserves of violets. Syrup of Roses make thus. Stiep fresh roses in hote water, the vessel being covered: when the water is cold, straine out the roses, &, heating the water againe, siep other roses therein this doe so often til the water be red. And this being purged with whites of egges, boile it with like quantitie of fine hony, until it be of convenient thicknes. If you prepare it for present uses, the lesse boiling wil serve, if you meane to keepe it, it requireth more, for which purpose the sunning of it is good: This purgeth a little, specially being new. \Sylv. med. simpl. mist. l3. Sylv. ibid./ 
Or thus. Stiep one pound of red rose leaves in 4 pound of water 24 howres. When the water is strained, put unto it 2 pound of fine hony, and boile it to the thicknesse of a syrup, taking of the skum as it riseth. It tempereth the hot affections of the braine, it quencheth thirst, it strengthneth the stomake, it procureth sleep, & staieth this rheumes, *Fern. Meth.lib.7./*

Therefore saith Lobel, *Mulsum, ubi aquæ plurimum, mellis non multum, diuturnam intestinaque mellis ebullitione in vinum longem utilissimum abis./* And Pictorius, *Hydromel longæ vetustate transit in vinum stomache convenientissimum./* Meth, when it is olde, is a wine most agreeable to the stomake: it recovereth 1 the appetite being lost, it 2. openneth the passage of the spirit or breath, it 3 softneth the bellie, it 4 is good for them that have the cough. 5 If a man take meth, not as his ordinarie drink, but, as physick, now and then; he shal receive much benefit by it, against quartan agues, against cacexies, and against the diseases of the braine, as *analepsie,/* & *epilepsie,/* or the falling evill: for which wine is pernicious: it 6 cureth the yelow jaundice: it 7 is also good against henbane with milke, and against the winter-cherie, it 8 nourisheth the body, 9 So that many have attained to long old age, only by the nourishment of meth.

twise or thrise, as before, lift it from the fire againe: and then take the bottome of an other earthen pot, or a little round bord with a handle in the middle like a churn-staffe, but without hoales: and having first wetted the bottom of it in cold water, dip it into the hot vessel, & assone as this wet bottome toucheth the wax, pul it out againe, and you shal have sticking to the bottome a thin cake, which when you have taken of, wet the bottome againe, and dip it as before: and thus do til you have taken up al the wax in cakes. These cakes hang in the open aire upon a line drawne through them, so that they may not touch one an other, besprinkling them with water in the sun-shine until they be white. If any man would have waxe whiter, let him boile it oftner, & do all other things in like manner as before.

\30 *Oile of wax./*/ And such is wax in his kind, both natural & artificial. Natural wax is altered by distillation into an oile of marvelous vertue. *Raymond Lulli/* greatly commendeth it, proving it to be rather a celestial or divine medicine then humane: because in wounds it worketh miraculously: which therfore is not so wel allowed of the common chirurgians. \31 *the vertues of it./*/ For it healeth a wound, be the same never so wide & big, being afore wide-stitched up, in the space of 11. daies or 12. at the most. But those that are smal, this oile healeth in 3. or 4. daies, by annointing only the wound therwith, and laying on a cloath wet in the same. It stayeth the sheding of the haire, either on the head or beard, by annointing the place therewith. 
Also for inwarde diseases, this oile worketh miracles, if you give one drachme at a time to drinke with white wine: for it is excellent in provoking urine which is stopped, it helpeth stitches and paines in the loines, it helpeth the cold gout, or sciatica, and all other griefes comming of cold. 
\32 * The making of oile of waxe./*/ The making or drawing of this oile is on this wise. Take of pure newe yelow waxe so much as will fill your retorte or bodie of glasse: melt it on the fire, and then powre it into sweete wine, wherein let it soake: wash it often, and wring it betweene your handes: then melt it againe and powre it into fresh wine, wherein soake it, wash it, and wring [cw: it]

When thus you have purified the waxe, to every pound therof adding fowre ounces of the powder of red bricke finely bruised, put it altogither into your retort of glasse wel fluted then set the retort into an \*V.n./*11/ earthen pot, filling it round about and beneath with fine sifted ashes or sand, & let the pot with the bodie in it on a furnace, and so distill it with a softe fire.

If you should rectifie this oile, or disill it often, untill it will congeale no more, then shall you make it over hot to take inwardly, and so quick in the mouth, that you cannot drinke it down. In the comming foorth of this oile, shal appear in the receiver, the fowre elements, the fire, the aire, the water, and the earth, right marvellous to see. 
\33 *The vertue of waxe in compound medicines./*/  So vertuous is waxe by it selfe, both in his owne kinde, and altered by distillation.

Now when thou haste, through my instruction, received the profite and pleasure, which these divine creatures abundantly yeelde; be thankful unto God, give him his part that giveth thee all, and pay justly the tithe of the increase: \Lev.17.30./ for God maketh claime unto that part, as peculiarly belonging to himselfe. So that, although he have assigned it to the priests & minsters for the time being, that are consecrated to do him service at his altar; yes doth he hold himselfe perpetually interessed therein. And therefore, howsoever some may thinke that in deteining thithes thet rob only men; yet the Lord doth charge such malefactours with a greater crime, saying *you have spoiled me:/* \Mal.3.8./ & when they taking it (as manie doe now) to be no such matter, did aske *wherein have we spoiled thee/*?

of the church, wil say, The paying of tithes was commanded by the law of Moses, but in the time of gospel it is not necessary: A competent exhibition indeed is to bee allotted to the clergie for their maintenance; but that may be better effected by other meanes, then by tithes. As though the foolishness of men were wiser then the wisdome of God: as though men in their blind and uncertaine imaginations could devise a better way for the continuall maintenance of the ministery and serive of God, then that which himselfe in his provident and al-seeing wisdome hath appointed.
This competent maintenance (as one wel saith) is a Castle built in the aire, which never yet stood upon the earth. It has beene indeed attempted in many places: but what is done? The tithes are wickedly wrestled from the true owners, and competent maintenance in liew therof, is a poore pittance (God wot), cut to the scantled, that it may serve only to keep them alive. Yea some of them are held in that base and contemptible state, that, to the great slaunder of the Gospel, and the scandell of the weaker sort, they are faine to goe from house to house for a morsel of bread. Can they think that God, who did sufficiently and liberally provide for the Priests under the law, hath least the Ministers of the glorious Gospel of Christ to the courtesie of them, which (as wofull ex- [cw: peti] [N]

perience doth dayly manifest) are more ready to rob, then reward them? Which do even straine their wits to the utmost, by one trick or other, to seaze upon their mangled portion, with griping talents to rent it piece-meale from them, and so, cruelly to prey upon them, which in the meane space doe pray for them? 
It cannot be denied that tithes were once the Lords, when it was said, \Lev.27.30/ *All the tith of the land, both of the seed of the ground and of the fruit of the trees, is the Lords, it is holy to the Lord./* If it were once his, why is it not his stil? Who is he that hath dispossessed him of his right? And if, being his, it were to be paid unto his servants the Priests and Levites, for the service of God under the law; why should it not likewise bee paied unto his servants the ministers of the word and sacraments, for the service of God under the law; why should it not likewise bee paies unto his servants the ministers of the same word and sacraments, for the service of the same God in the Gospel? Our saviour reproving the Scribes and Pharises, because they stood more upon the observation of the smaller duties of the law, then of those that were greater; saith unto them \Mat.23./ *Yee tithe mint & anise & cummin, & leave the weightier matters of the law, as judgement and mercy and fidelity/*; giving his sentence of them both, *These things ought you to have done and not to have leaft the other undone./* Where you may see that Christ himselfe commaundeth the paying of tithes, which are the smaller things; though hee prefer judgement and [cw: mer-]

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

mercy & fidelity, which are the greater things, of the moral & perpetuall law of God. So doth that ancient father *Origen/* expound these words of Christ, shewing that the commandement of paying tithes is to bee observed according to the letter, *Ut hæc observanda, etiam secundum luteram, ipsus Dei vocibus doceantur; dicit Dominus in evangelus, va vobis, &c. Vide ergo diligentius, quomodo sermo Domini vult fieri quidem omnimode quæ majora sunt legis, nontamen omitti & hæc quæ secundum literam designantur./* And therefore in the same place he saith, *Non mihi videtur buisimodi anima habere memoriam Dei, nec cogitare nec credere quia Deus dederit fructus quos cepit, quos ita recondit quasi alienos a Deo. Si enim a deo sibi datos crederet, sceret utique, munerando sacerdotes, honorare Deum de datis & muneribus suis./* Likewise S. *Cyprian/*, who lived in his time. After them *Chrysotome/*, and *Jerome/*, who hath many places to this purpose, as these, \In Mal.3.8./ *Quod de decimis diximus, quæ olim dabantur a populo sacerdotibus & Levitis, in ecclesiæ quoqe, populis intelligite./* And againe, *Ecclesiæ populis præceptum est dare decimus./* \Ibid./ Also S. *Ambrose/*, S. *Augustine/*, *Leo/* the first, *Gregorie/* the great, with the other good bishops of the Sea of Rome.

before and after have confirmed the same. 
So that this Catholike doctrine was alwaies taught and observed in the Church of Christ without controlement or contraditcion, untill that Antichrist sitting in the seate of God, but teaching doctrines of Devils, as hee corrupted other waightie points of christian religion, presumed also to change the right & ancient use of tithes, and translated them from the ordinary Pastors and Curats, unto regular or rather irregular Priests, which wickedly wasted them in idle Monasteries. 
But that lay men, which wait not at the altar, should lay their prophane hands upon the Lords portion and receive tithes, is such a sin, as the man of sinne himselfe would not attempt, and such an abhomination as in former ages among Christians or heathen the world never heard of; nor ever was knowne in this famous Iland, since first it imbraced the faith of Christ, until that strange act, whereby the Church was unmercifully spoiled, not only of hir lands, the gifts of men; but of hir tithes also, the gift of God. The fact of *Charles Martel/* in France was indeed more ancient? For there a portion of tithes was granted to this Champion for the defence of the Church, against the violent irruptions of the barbarous Gothes & Vandals, which would have robbed and ruined the Church: but here [cw: the] [N3]

===

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

the tithes were given to the robbers themselves. Since which time, they are so farre from restitution, or any remorse of the fact, that they daily thirst after that little which is leaft: and, like drunken men, the more they drinke, the drier they are. It is a world to see how witty & diligent they are in laying plots, which flufes and flights they invent and practise for the withholding of tithes: abusing the very laws to their purpose, and making even those to maintaine their sacrilege, which were made to a contrary ende. 
\An.45.Ed.3/ If in former times, when the land was so overgrowne with trees that it had enough for it selfe and other countries also, it were enacted, that *wheras men did sel their great wood to merchants to their owne profit, or in aide of the kind in his wars, and the merchants were impleaded in the spirituall court for the tithes of the said wood, whereby the owners cannot sell their woods to the very valew, to the great damage of them and of the realme: it is ordained that in this case a prohibition shal be granted. &c./* If this I say have been enacted, the the worde *great wood/* or timber trees, shalbe taken in the largest sense, and shal containe not only oake, elme, and ash; but beech also and maple, for they be trencher-timber, and with some withy also, for that is harow-timber, and I doubt not but in a while they wil have under-wood and al, & say tis fire timber, as in many places they have [cw: begun]

===

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

begunne already. And these trees shalbe tith-free, not body only, but bough also; not only when they are felled, but as often as they are lopped. Whereas, if the meaning of the statute may be knowne by the wordes, the statute giveth way to none of al these evils. For first, there is no mention at al in these words of any immunity or discharge of tithe: unles they wil say that wheresoever a prohibition is granted in a cause of tith, there he that sueth for tith must loose it: which, albeit the modern practise make it seeme probable, yet wil they not say that it is perpetual. But bee it so. Yet how doth this concerne the lops of trees which are cut from the standing stems, and serve not for timber but for fuel? Nay where are the trees themselves, as now they are used, freed from tith? It is ordained byt his law, that *wheras great wood is sold to merchants for the owners profit, or in aide of the king in his warres, &c. in this case a prohibition shalbe granted./* They therfore that would pay no tith must shew that their case is this case (which I think in these daies few can do) or els their trees are no more freed from tithing by this statute, then any other fruits of the earth: as good reason is they should not be, seeing God giveth the increase of them with so little cost & care. But even in this case, where the bodies were discharged of tith, because they were sold to the merchants (who, if they should pay for [cw: the] [N4]

===

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

the tith to the church, would not give the ful value of the timber to the seller, to the great damage of the Realme) the boughes were not exempted which were least behinde, for which the merchantes could not bee inpleaded; nor the Realme receive any great damage, if the parson made him a fire with the tenth part? 
If the law have said, that barren beach or wast ground, which before this time have been barren and paide no tith by reason of the same barrennes, being now improved and converted into arable grounde or medow, shall after seaven yeeres pay tith; this is sufficient reason for some, when they have grubbed up a few bushes or trees in a fat & fertil ground, to pay no tith thereof for seaven yeeres after: whereas indeed the law speaketh only of such ground, as *by reason of his barrennesse did pay no tithe./* But in the next proviso, it speaketh of ground that yeeldeth some tith. That cannot be understoode of tith that the grounde yeeldeth in any fruit: for then there would follow a manifest contradiction betweene the two provisoes, the first speaking of land, that, by reason of his barrennes, yeeldeth no tith: the seconde saying, that such land yeeldeth some tith: neither do the words of themselves import such meaning: for it is not said, *if any such ground have yeelded or brought forth any tithe: but if any such barren ground have bin charged to pay any tithe/* as it might formerly have beene, by some composition or [cw: agree-]

===

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

agreement, either by it selfe, or in general with other land: though now, by reason of this barrennes, it yeels no tith *in specie./* But it is said in the later proviso, that it *shal pay that charged tithe during those seaven yeeres/*, and therefore no reason that it shoulde also pay the tith which it yeeldeth *in specie/* during the same time. True: for how should we blame them that pay lesse then the tith, if we would recieve more then the tithe, sith both are alike unjust. But the ecclesiastical law yet in force requiring the tithe *in specie/*, & this statute, requiring it according to a former rate, if by the benefit of either law wee take but one of them, we have but our due, which neither equity nor any law forbiddeth. These provisoes then concerne only such ground as, by reason of the barrennes thereof, yeeldeth no tith in fruit; though, by some agreement it might be charged to pay some kind of tith. But howsoever, this law is altogither affirmative, commanding, not forbidding the payment of tithe, as being made purposely in favour of the cleargy. For it doth not say, that seaven yeeres after the improvement it shal pay no tithe; but, leaving it for those seaven yeers *statu quo prius/*, doth ordein that after those seaven yeeres, notwithstanding any former agremeent or other pretence (*unlesse it were discharged by an act of parliament/*) it shal thence-forth pay tithe *in kind/*. So that the very letter of the law giveth no such advantage [cw: unto]

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

unto the evil disposed, that with any sense it can bee enforced against the good meaning of the law-makers, which, as appeareth by the title, preamble, and the whole tenor of the act, was made for the good (as it is said) of the clergy, & not for their hurt, as now, by the iniquity of the times, it is used. 
If the same law, for the true payment of personal tithes by the Merchants, Clothiers, Buyers and sellers, and other trades-men, shal but say, that it shal bee lawful to use all lawfull and reasonable meanes, *other then the parties owne corporall oath/*; this shal be an occasion unto many, yea, if not to all, to almost all, to discharge themselves of al such dues. For albeit the personal tithes of the husbandmen; yet they which by their trafike or trade have gained cleerely 40, 50, yea hundreds of pounds, are not ashamed to come to the Church at Easter, like poore day-labourers, with their bare two-peny-offering: but as for their tithes, because they cannot be put to their othes to say what they are, they keepe both the knowledge and paiment of them from the Priest, and make no reckoning at al to honour God *de datis & manneribus suis/*, out of his owne giftes and benefitess as if God were the God of the husbandmen only, and not of the trades-men; or as if they re [cw: ceived]

ceived not their temporal, not expected eternal blessings at his hands. For otherwise with what face could they appeare before the Lord in his sanctuarie, and there, as chiefe members of his Church, take up the chiefest roomes; and yet contribute nothing towards his service and worship, in whome they live, and move, and have their being? 
If an other branch of the same act, to confirme the ancient both *right/* and *manner/* of tithing, shal say that *every of the Kings subjects shal pay their tithes truly and justly in their proper kinde, in such manner and forme as hath beene of right paid within/* 40 *yeeres next before the making of this act/*; this law shalbe wrested to maintaine the deteining of the greatest part of some tithes, that is, the withholding of tithes of a great value for the payment of trifles in liew thereof. (Whereas, if they would redeeme their tith, in equitie they should adde somewhat more.) \Lev.17.31/ And yet this Law, which is pretended to justifie this injurie, in the hardest constructuon that it may beare, can not imply any such matter, but doth indeed plainly command the contrary. For it doth not say they shal pay the twentieth, or the fortieth, or the hundreth part (as in some cases, by pretence of this law, some use to do) but they shall pay *the tithe/*, 1. the tenth part.

Nowe for the manner of this true and just paying of tithe *in specie or in their proper kinde/* (which in diverse places is different, as to tith corne in sheafe or in shocke, to thithe lambes by choice or by running, to tithe wooll by weight or by the order of the flieces, &c.) it is here commanded to bee such, *as hath beene of right used forty yeeres before the making of that act./* For which an other statute hath after the laudible usages and customes of the parish or place where hee dwelleth.\An.27.H.8.c.20/ Both which clauses are a plaine declaration of the ecclesiastical law, which saith, *Non tolluntur consuetudines diversæ.

*campis, sed in horreo proprio: alii ducunt illam decimam in horreum sacerdotis. Unde in talibus & similibus non potest esse uniformis petitio decimarum, saltem ut servetur idem modus reddendi; licet sit uniformitas, ut integra solvatur decima sine diminutione./* The diverse customes, which consist in the divers manner of tithing, are not taken awaie. For some do tithe by sheafes cast here & there in the furrows: others tith by the hiles & shocks, the sheafes being gathered togither, &c. So that in these and the like, there cannot be kept an uniforme manner of paying tithe, although ther be this uniformity, that the whole tithe be paide without diminution. So then to use to pay lesse then the tithe, which by no law is alowed, is a custome not *in modo decimandi/*, but *in non decimando/*: for hee cannot bee saide to pay the tithe, that payeth but part of the tithe, unless it bee by the helpe of a *Synecdoche/*: \*Pars pro toto./*/ which trope in the matter of tithing is verie frequent. But, not withstanding the sense of the wordes & manifest meaning of both lawes, say it were a custome *in modo decimandi/*: yet, I hope, they will not say it is *a laudible usage or custome/* to steale a goose and sticke up a feather; to defraude a poor Vicar of his maintenance by keeping away his tith for a thing of nothing. When these bargains were begun, the mony, no doubt, was the ful worth of the tith; for otherwise by the law they could not have stood: but now the pri- [cw:ces]

ces of things are so enhaunsed; that, if al tithes should be sold accordingly, he that is now able to give to him that asketh, would bee glad to aske, if any would give. If the lawyers should receive the rents of their purchased lands after this rate, they would surely have more pittie of their poore Pastors.
If any man therefore, by some over-reaching match or other pretense, have used to keepe back part of his tith; this cannot warrant him to doe so still (for a custome of sinning, doth not extenuat but aggrivate the sin) but should rather provoke him to make satisfaction at an other time, for the former wrong: and so surely would doe, if men did not preferre the worship of their earthly *Mammon/*, before the service of the God of heaven.
Thus you see how injuriously this good law is rakt, and made to speake that which it never meant. But this is not all: there is yet a farther use, or rather abuse made of it. The great ones, suppose Patrones, Justices, and other rich men wil not only hold that which they have fingered; but, by virtue of this law, or rather by the vice of their greedy mindes, doe practise dayly to make new customes. First they wil buy their tithes of the poore Minister, specially if hee be obnoxious unto them, at what rate they list; or else hee shal have their heavy displeasure, the which his weaknes can hardly beare.

Yea some have in their hearts so hardened this sin, that if their tithes have beene forborne for a time, for feare, or favour, or inabilitie to endure the charge of suit, or some other respect: they will be ready to claim an immunity, refusing to pay either tith or any thing for it. If you demaund your due, their answer is, Wee have not used to pay any thing, nor any thing wil pay.  If you say There is no custome *in non decimando/*, that wil not serve, you must sue them, if you will have it: which if you doe, and happily bee able to hold out till sentence, yet are you not much the neere, you shal then be called into other courts, where you are sure to be held so long (to the losse of your times which should otherwise be imployed, and to the exhausting of your little livlyhood which were fitter to be bestowed upon your family & other poore people) that it had bin better for you to let them goe quietly away with it, & thanke them too, that they would have no more.

But imagin that they were indifferent, & that the cause did not concerne them; yet how can they be thought fitte judges in a cause of tithe, seeing neither they nor their informers have knowledge in that law, whereby the right of tithe doth stand: and therefore must needes speake as skilfully in such questions, as that great disputer would have done in the common law: Who, as it is reported, comming into England, and making here a general chalenge to dispute with al commers *in omni scibili/*, was undertaken by *St Thomas More/*; who proposed unto him this question. *An averia captain in Withernamia sint replegibilia/*.

For they turn whole livings into Pasture, and into this pasture put nothing but kine; and so, all being demised together, if it yeeld the owner a rent of 20 pound (the due tith whereof is 40 shillings) the poore minister shal be bobd with scarce 40!d!.

Nether yet, in this great inundation of oppressions, hath the Church found such friends, as would oppose themselves against the rage thereof, but that the floud over-floweth where it listeth, and the violent streame carieth al afore it. In ancient times, when wronges were not so rife, the Churches had their Patrons to defend their rights. The name remaineth unto this day: but the nature is quite changed. For al the enimies, that the Church hath, the Patrones, for the most part, are now growne the greatest. In stead of defending, they spoile the Church for the effecting whereof they have many feat devises. Some give two livings at once, that, at the least, they may have one again: some allow only an annuall pension, reserving [cw: the]

In this pitiful taking, or rather loosing, are now the servants of God: thus are wee rewarded for our paines. Doe wee minister unto you heavenly thinges, and wil not you give us, not yours, but our owne carnall thinges? In former ages, when people were truely religious, they thought they could never doe enough for their bodies, from whom they received the food of their soules. They were so farre from taking ought from them, that the studied continually by al meanes to give more unto them. It is therefore a shrewd presumption, that, howso ever men professe religion, and are contended to be called christians, yet their love to christian religion is not great, whose love is so little to the ministers thereof: The which upon all occasion is ready to shew it selfe, not only in withholding from us that which is due, but also in requiring of us that which is not due.

For whereas they pretend it is to the King, that is but a cloake to cover the evil: seeing his majestie is either to have of them the full sum agreed upon by composition, or else to take it up by his purveiers, as he doth in other countries: where the Ministers are yet free by vertue of that law. Why then are wee only unlawfully oppressed? 
So that, what with the new-found lay parsonages, what with pretended immunities, what with hard lawes and harder constructions, what with unwilling and false tithers, what with the subtil practices of Patrons, & what with the unkind dealing of many neighbours, the Priests portion is least so short, that the land must needes run into the opprobious & scandalous sinne of *Jeroboam/*, that made Priests of the lowest people.

They which are any causes of these accursed evils, let them take heed to themselves in time, and with penitent mindes desist from this prophane and irreligious sacrilege: lest the curse of God overtake them, which hath already fallen heavy upon the chiefe authors and actors of that sinne. For as to the principal, which was so ful of wives and children, and did so flow in infinit sums and masses of gold & silver, himselfe saw the end of the one; which did sodainely consume and come to nought: & wee have seene the end of the other; for at this day God hath not leaft him one to sit in his seate, but in the next generation his name is cleane put out. And for the rest, some of them did pay the price of their impiety in their owne persons, as being untimely & ignominously cut of from the earth: others in their posterity, which are either quite rooted out, or live in obscuritie and contempt. That a man may say of them all, as the Prophet did of the wicked in his time, *I have seene the ungodly in great prosperity, and florishing like a greene bay-tree. And I went by, & loe he was gon; I fought him, but his place could no where be found./*

Fathers did therefore about in all riches, because they gave their tithes to God: whom if thou wilt no heere, yet heere the truth it selfe. \Mal.3.10/ *Bring yee al the tithes into the store-house: that there may be meate in mine house: and prove me now herewith (saith the Lord of hosts) if I wil not open the windowes of heaven, and powre you out a blessing without measure./*
Now if, not withstanding al this, against the uniforme doctrine and practise of the Church of Christ in the purer times, against the confirmations of godly Kinges and people, against the generall current of Fathers and Couucels teaching the law of the tithe to be perpetual according to the word of God as wel in the new testament as in the old, there be any so refractarie as yet to say, that tenth part, howsoever convenient, is not so necessarie but that it may be changed into a greater or better part, rather than taken into a lesse: that as the work of the Ministers is greater, better, and more glorious then of the Priests; so they might be more honoured, better regarded, and more liberally rewarded. But this kind of change is so unfitting to these mens purpose; that I think they would chuse rather to change their opinion, & reteine stil the Ancient Catholike doctrine of the Church, *Leges divinæ sacerdotibus & ministris ec-/* [cw:*clesiarum/*]
