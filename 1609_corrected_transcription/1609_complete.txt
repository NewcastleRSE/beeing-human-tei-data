#THE PREFACE/#  

##*to the Reader./*/##  

{T}He great naturalist, to expresse the excellencie of the nature of Bees, saith thus, *Inter omnia insecta principatus apibus et jure præcipua admiratio; solis ex eo genere hominum causam genitis/*. Of all *insecta/* the Bees are chiefe, and worthily to bee most admired; beeing the only thinges of that kinde, which are bred for the behoofe of men. The later part of which saying although the delicat Silk-worme have else-where disproved, and is now setting foot in this land, here also to except against it; yet must shee needs confesse the former, and, when shee is come, yeelde the precedence to the laborious Bee, as to hir elder sister; which as in time, so in vertue is before her. For the fruite of the Silke-worme serveth onlie to cover the bodie; but the fruite of the Bee to nourish and cure it: that is to bee applied outwardly, this to be inwardly received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health & necessitie. But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bees is so great and won-

derful, so comely for order and beauty, so excellent for art and wisdome, and so full of pleasure and profit; that the contemplation thereof may well beseeme an ingenious nature. And therefore not without cause are the Bees called the Muses birds.\*Var.l.3.ca.16./*/
The love of which did so ravish *Aristomachus/* and *Philiseus/*, that, as *Plinie/* reporteth,\*Nat hist.li.II./*/ they were pleased to spend most of their time in this pleasing busines. *Nequis/* (saith hee) *miretur amore carum captos Aristomachum Solensem duodesexaginta annis nihil aliud egisse; Philiscum vero Thasium in desertis apes colentem Agrium cognomimatum: qui ambo scripsere de his/*. *Aristotle/* thought his *Historia animalium/* unperfect, unles he had inserted a tract of the nature of Bees: of which hee discourseth more at large, then he doth of any other living creature. *Plinie/* likewise in his *Naturalis historia/* is very copious in this argument. Besides whom, divers other haue written therof: as *Columella, Varro, Palladius, Averroes/*. Yea the learned and grave fathers of the Church *S. Ambrose/* and *Isidore/* have thought it a subject fit for their pens. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later times both in Latine & English; which haue written many things of these admirable creatures. 
But in al their writings they seeme unto me to say little out of experience, and to rely more upon the relation of others; then anie certaine

knowledge of their owne. Notwithstanding in some of them, specially in *Aristotle & Plinie/*, are scatered many true and good observations; which, being found agreeable to experience, I have here and there, as occasion required, for authority and ornament interlaced. But the later writers, imitating the ancient where they thought good, choosing some of their directions and refusing others, doe, for the most part, unluckely light upon the worse: so that being compared, they are no way matchable unto them; whome by the advantage of time they might haue surpassed. Among which *Georgius Pictorius/* a learned Physitian deserveth best, as having taken most paines in perusing the ancient authors, and gathering their matter into his methode. Whom one *T. H./* of London translating word for word into English as wel as he could, concealing the authors name, adventured to publish in his owne name. These and the like when a scholar hath thoroughly read, he thinketh himselfe throughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth abroad to put his skil in practise, every silie woman is ready to deride his learned ignorance. 
Wherefore considering howe greate the vertue and efficacy of the fruite of these \v.c.10.p.3/ creatures is, both for the preserving, and restoring of mans health, I thought it not amisse to spend some by-time for my recreation, in sear-[cw:ching]

ching out the nature & properties of Bees, that I might know how to do good unto them, which are so good for us, and what is the due & righte ordering of these delightful, profitable, and necessary creatures. And having to my contentment, though to my cost, in some sort attained my desire, I was incited, even by the rule of charity, to communicate that to my neighbours & countrymen, which I haue found so beneficiall to my selfe: so that the reader may now freely reape the fruite of that, which the author hath deerly sowen vnto him.
\*De generat.an.l.3.c.10/*/ The Philosopher intreating of the breeding of Bees, professeth himselfe uncertaime of their sex: and therefore, willing in this uncertainty to grace so worthy a creature with the worthier title, he every where calleth their governor *βασιλεύς/*, or *Rex/*. As many as followed him, searching no farther then he did, were contente to say as he said. So that I am enforced (unlesse I wil choose rather to offend in *rebus/* then in *vocibus/*) by their leave and thine (learned reader) to straine the common signification of the word *Rex/*, and, in such places, to translate it *Queene/*, sith the males heer beare no sway at al, this being an *Amazonian or Feminine kingdome. v./* \*V.c.4.n.20.&22./*/
In distinguishing the times of the yeer, I use the Astronomical months as most natural and fitting to my purpose; beginning each month with the day that the sun entreth into his sign,

$*to the Reader./*/$ 

& giuing the name of each signe to his month; because the most notable thinges concerning Bees, which are to be observed in them or to be done for them fal out in the beginnings of these months. Where note that by the name of each month, is commonly understood the first day of the same month (namely wheresovever this preposition *at/* is set before it) except only where it followeth the preposition *in/* or *after/*, or otherwise the sense doth plainely shew that it is spoken of the whole month. 
I am out of doubt that this book of *Bees/* wil in his infancy be hidden in obscurity as the book of *tropes and figures/* did for a while go unregarded, without friends or acquaintance: But as that did by litle & litle insinuat it selfe into the love & liking of many schooles, yea of the Vniversity it selfe, where it hath been both privatly and publikley read (a favour which this mother doth seldome afford to hir owne children, least happily shee should seeme too fond over them) so this will in time travaile into the most remote partes of this great kingdome of greate *Britaine/*, and be entertained of al sorts both learned and unlearned: although the *Muses/* birdes are fittest for the *Muses/*, & the knowledge of their long-hidden secrets was cheifly published for the *Muses friends/*. *Quibus me, quic quid sum, & studia mea dico. Wotton. Jul. II. 1609./*

#A TREATISE CONCER-

##*Of the nature and properties of Bees, and of their Queene./*
CHAP. I./##

{A}Mong all the creatures which our bountifull GOD hath made for the use and service of man, in respect of (I) great profit with small cost (2) of their ubiquity or beeing in al countries, and (3) of their continual labour and consenting order, the Bees are most to be admired. \*1. Bees yeelde great profit with smal cost/*/ For first with the provision of a hive and some little care and attendance, which need be no hinderance to other busines, but rather a delightful recreation amid the same, they bring in store of sweete delicates most holesome both for meate and medicine, \Ambrosius Hex.amer.l.5.cap.21./ *Fructum apum ab omnibus desideratur, & quæritur: nec pro personarum diversitate discernitur, sed indiscreta sui gratia regibus pariter ac mediocribus aquali suavitate dulcescit: nec solum voluptati, sed etiam/* [cw:salu-]

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$
\Pli nat.hist I.ii.c.5/ *salutiest./* And another saith, *Mille ad usus vitæ laborem tolerant & opera conficiunt/* : as they wel know who know the rare vertues of hony and waxe: a taste whereof I wil give you in the last chapter. \*2 Every country for for bees./*/ Secondly whereas *non omnis fert omnia tellus,/* some country yeeldeth one fruit, some another, some beareth one graine, some an other some breedeth one kind of cattle, some an other: there is no ground of what nature soever it be, whether it be hot or colde, wet or drie, hil or dale, woodland or champian, meddow, pasture, or arable: in a word whether it be battle or barren, which yeeldeth not matter for the Bee to work upon. \*3 Bees abhorre idlenesse./*/ And thirdly in their labor and order at home and abroad they are so admirable, that they may be a patterne unto men both of the one and of the other. For unlesse they be let by wether, weaknes, or want of matter to worke on, their labour never ceaseth. \Plin. nat. hist.l.ii.c.5/ In admiration whereof one saith,  *Quos efficacia industriæque, tantæ comparemus nervos? quai vires? quos ratione medius fidius viros?/* \*4 Bees have a commonwealth/*/ & for their order it is such that they may wel be said to have a common wealth, since all that they do is in common without any privat respect. \Nat hist III.31.c.5/ *Nihil norunt nisi commune:/* They work for al, they watch for al, they fight for al. \5 *Their working, watching, fighting, dwelling, diet, wealth and young ones are all in common./*/ In their private quarrels when they are from the hive or common treasury, howsoever you use them they wil not resist, if by any meanes they can get away. *Cum ruri sint, nec sibi/* 
[cw: *invicem/*] 

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

\Arist.hist.anim.lib.9.cap.40/ *invicem, nec ullis aliis nocent; at vero apud suos al veos pugnant accrimè/*: their dwelling and diet are common to al alike: they have like common care both of their wealth and young ones.
\Ambr.Hex.lib.5.ca.21/ *Solæ in omni genere animantium communem omnibus sobolem habent, unam omnes incolunt mansionem, unius patriæ clauduntur limine, in commune omnibus labor, communis cibus, communis operatio, communis usus, & fructus est./* \6 Bees alwaies loial to their soveraigne./ And al this under the government of one Monarch, of whom above all things they have a principal care & respect, loving, reverencing, and obeying her in al things. 
\Virg Geor/ *Præterea regem non sic Ægyptus & ingens
Lydia, nec populi Parthorum aut Medus Hydaspes 
Observant: rege incolumi mens omnibus una est:
Amisso rupere fidem: contructaque una est:

Ille operum custos, illum admirantur: & omnes

Et sæpe attollunt humeris, & corpora bello

If she goe forth to solace her selfe (as sometime she will) many of them attend upon her, garding her person before and behind; they which come forth before her ever now & then returning, and looking back, and making withall an extraordinarie noise, as if they spake the language of the knight Marshalls men, & so away they fly together, & anon in like man-

ner they attend her back againe. This I may say because I have seene it: although the Philosopher be of another mind *Reges/*, saith hee, *nunquam foris visuntur, niscum migratur./* \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40/ If by hir voice she bid them goe, they swarme; if being abroad she dislike the weather, or lighting place, they quickly returne home againe; while she cheereth them to battaile they fight *v/*, \Vid.c.7.n.32./ when she is silent they cease, while she is well, they are cheerefull about their worke, if she droope, they faint also: if she dy, they will never after prosper, but thenceforth languish till they bee dead too. *Rege mortuo mæret plebs ignava, non cibos convebit, non procedit, tristi tantum murmure glomeratur circa corpus eius./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.i7/ \7 Bees endure no government, but a Monarchie/But if they have many Princes, as when two fly away with one swarme, or when two swarmes are hived to gether; they strike one of them presently, and sometime they bring her downe that evening to the mantle, *v/*. \v.?.5.n.39/ where you may find hir covered with a little heape of Bees, otherwise the next day they carie her forth either dead or deadly wounded. Likewise if the olde Queene bring forth many Princes (as she may have six or seaven, yea sometime halfe a skore or more which superfluitie nature affordeth for more suretie, in case some miscarrie) then lest the multitude of rulers should distract the unstable commons into factions, within two daies after the last swarme, you shall finde them that remained [cw: dead]

$*and of their Queene./*/$

dead before the hive: I have taken eight of them up together brought out of one hive, when two were already gon forth with their swarmes. For the Bees abhorre as well polyarchie, as anarchie, God having shewed in them unto men an expresse patterne of a perfect monarchie, the most natural & absolute form of government. 
The Queene-bee is a Bee of a comely and stately shape, browne of colour as other Bees, \8 The description of the queene-Bee/ but that her belly is more bright: she is longer then a honi-bee, by one third part, that is almost an inch long: she is also bigger then a honi-bee but not so big as a drone, although somwhat longer: hir head proportionable, but that is more round then the little Bees, by reason hir fanges be shorter: hir tonge not halfe so long as the little Bees: for where as they gather with one nectar, with the other ambrosia, she hath no need to use either, beeing to bee maintained, as other Princes, but the labour of hir subjects; hir wings of the same size with a smal Bee, & therefore in respect of her long body, they seeme very short, for they reach but to the middle of hir nether part: hir legges, proportionable, and of the colour of hir belly, but hir two hin-legges more yellowe: hir nether part so long, and halfe so long as hir upper part, more picked then a smale Bees, and without such three whitish ringes as other Bees have at the three partitions: the speere she hath is but little, and not halfe so [cw:long] [A3]

===

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$

long as the other Bees: which, like a kings sword, is borne rather for shewe and authoritie, then for any other use: For it belongeth to her subjects, as well to fight for her, as to provide for her. \Nat.hist.li.II.cap.17./ *Plinie/* writeth thus doubtingly of it. *Non constat inter authores rex nullumne solus habeat aculeum, majestate tantum armatus, an dedent eum quidem natura, sed usum eius illi tantum negavent; illud constat imperatorem aculeo non uti/* 
But *Arist/*; doth truely approve the later opinion as certaine: \Hist.an.l.5.cap.21./ *Reges aculeos habent, sed non utuntur. Que circa carere eos aculeis nonnulli existimant./* If you desire to see this stately Prince, read ca.5.n.27 \Nat.hist.iI.c.16/ *Plinie/* describeth the Queene-bees thus, *Omnibus forma semper egregia, & duplo quam cæteris maior, pennæ breviores, crura recta, ingressus celsior, in fronte macula quodam diademate candicans: Multum etiam nitore a vulgo differunt./* \9 Bees have also inferior governors or captaines./ \10 Which are knowne by peculiar markes./
Besides their soveraigne the Bees have also subordinate governors and leaders, not unfitly resembling Captaines & coronels of soldiers: For difference from the rest they beare for their crest a tufte or toffel in some coloured yellow, in some murrey, in maner of a plume; whereof some turne downward like an ostrich-feather, others stand upright like a hearn-top. And of both sorts some are greater, and some lesse, as if there were degrees of those dignities among them. In all other respects they are like to the vulgar. These I think are they that *Plinie/* mea-

neth, where he saith, *circa regem satellites quidam lictoresque, assiduæ custodes authoritatis./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.17/ In lesse then a quarter of an houre you may see three or foure of them come forth of a good stale; but chief-ly in *Gemini/* before their continuall labour have worne these ornaments. So that he might well say \Plin.Nat.hist.Li.II.c.5/ *Rempublicam habent, consilia, ac duces./* Al which he that seriously considereth must with admiration acknowledge that singular wisdome, order, and government in them, which in no other creature, man only excepted (if yet to be excepted) is to be found; whence some have inferred a farther matter 
\Vir.Geor.4/ 
*His equidam signis atque hæc exempla sequuti, 
Esse apibus partem divinæ mentis, & haustus 
Æthereos dixere--/* 
\II *Two sorts of Bees./*/\Hist l.9?.40/ Aristotle maketh two sortes of Bees, the one (which is best) short, divers coloured, & round; the other long like unto waspes. *Optimum genus apum quæ breves variæ & in rotunditatem compactiles, secundæ quæ longæ & vespis similes./* And in an other place he putteth a difference betweene wilde and tame saying, *Differunt inter se apes parentibus natæ urbanis & qua rustico montanoque victu educatis prodierint: sunt enim ha sylvestres horridiores aspectu, & iracuudiores, & minores, sed opere & labore præstantiores./* Whom *Plinie/* followeth almost verbatim, saying *Apes sunt etiam rustica sylvestresque, horridæ aspectu, multo iracundiores, sed opere ac labore præstantiores. Urbanarum duo gene/* 
[cw: *ra/*]

===

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees,/*/$

*ra optimæ breves, variæque, & in rotuntitatem compactiles; deteriores longæ, & quibus similitudo vesparum etiamnum deterrimæ ex iis pilosæ./* But these differences my experiece hath not found, neither doe I see how they can be, seeing the swarmes of tame Bees doe often fly into trees, & so become wilde: and the swarmes of wild Bees are not seldome found, and put into hives. Indeed the wild are more angry then the tame: but that is because they are lesse used to the companie of men. Moreover there is some difference in the bignesse of Bees. For they that are loaded seeme greater and longer then those that are leene: also the Nyphs *v/* \v.c.4.n.17/: when they come first abroad are not growne to their full bignesse which afterward they have, and the old ones doe wither, and become little againe *v/* \v.n.54/: Like-wise in these three ages their colours also doe varie: for in their middle age they are browne, whereas before they are more pale, *v./* \v.c.4.n.14/ and at the last they turne whitish againe, *v./* \v.n.54/ But these are differences of Bees in the same stall, & not of one stall from another, since these diverse sorts are in every stall. 
The severall parts of a Bee have their several uses. \12 The parts of a Bee./ Hir hornes growing in the middle of hir fore-head, with two jointes, one close to the head, the other towards the middle, so that she can put them forth at full length when she wil, and drawe them in againe close to her head 
[cw: serve] 

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

serve to give warning in the darke, and when shee is busie, of any thing quicke or dead that might offend her. 
\14 *Hir fangs/*/ For gathering hir provision shee hath two instruments, hir fangs and hir tongue: hir fangs in fashion of a paire of pincers, hang not, as the jawes of other things one over an other, but side way one against the other, as is most convenient for hir uses. 
\15 *Hir tongue with the parts of it/*/ Hir tongue is of that length, that hir mouth cannot hold it, but being doubled betweene hir fangs under hir chinne, it reacheth to the necke. It is divided into three parts: whereof the two outmost serve as a case to cover the third, which being the chiefe, the Bee in hir worke putteth forth beyond the other, & draweth in againe as she wil. And this third part is likewise parted into three, so that there are five in all. 
\16 *Her fowre wings/*/ To set these instruments on worke, nature hath furnished her with fowre winges, which swifter then the East-winde carry her into all the fowre coasts of the world, and thence with hir pretious lading beare her backe againe, untill hir incessant labour hath worne them out. *v/*. \v.n.54./
\17 *Hir feete/*/ Hir rough and deuclawed feete apt to take hold at the first touch are in number six, that she may stand fast upon fowre, while she useth the other two to wipe her eies, hir wings, hir tongue, or any other part, and to convay the

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$

gathering of hir fanges to hir thighes. *v/*. \v.c.6 n.16.18/ 
\18 *Her two weapons./*/ For hir defence shee is doubly weaponed. \19 *Her fanges commonly used against insecta./*/ Hir fanges she useth when she is not much angry, against al *insecta/*, as other Bees, Drones, Waspes, &c. therewith pinching and holding them commonly by the legs or wings, & some time by the hornes: but this is rather a chiding, then a fighting, & a warning, rather then a punishment, though with al sometime shee bend hir speere against them, as if shee would kil & slay. 
\20 *Her speer sometime./*/ Hir speere she is very loth to use, if by any other meanes she can shift hir enimy, as knowing how dangerous it is to hirselfe: for if shee chance therwith to strike any hard part, as the brest or shoulder, she is enforced to leave hir speere behinde her, and so she killeth & is killed with the same stroke. Yet when the Bees are very angry; as namely when they are assalted with a multitude of robbers at once, *v/*. \v:c.7.n.34/ or when in the spring a hungry stall forsaking his owne home presseth into their hive, *v/*. \v.c.n.46/ they fal sodainly upon them with their poisoned speeres (*Apibus natura cuspides dedit, & quidem venenatas/*) \Nat.hist.li.21.c.13.21/ but then they make short worke: for by that time they have put up their weapons, some die presently, \21. *Stinging present death to Bees./*/ others loosing the use of their wings tumble on the ground like mad things, until in a while they loose their lives too: others when they are wounded run away in great hast (as having their

$*and of their Queene./*/$

errand) either drawing on the ground one or more of their legs, or doubling their nether part toward the ground, or turning the same awry to the one side or the other: but as many as are striken, within an howre after will not be able to wagge out of the place, and within two or three at the most, they will be quite dead. I have looked on, while thus they quickly cut of a whole stale, and among them the rest, making then no difference, they spared not the Queene her selfe. After this maner doe they deale with the drones at the time of the yeare, when they wil not otherwise be beaten away. 
\22 *The speares commonly used against other creatures/*/ But their speares or stings they use chiefly against things of other sort, as men, beastes, and fowles, which have outwardly some offensive excrement, as haire or feathers, the touch wherof provoketh them to sting; \23 *Haire & feathers cause the Bees to sting./*/ although such stinging be alwaies mortall to themselves (as anon is shew'd *v/*) \*v.n.27.28./*/ for the skin having received the sting holdeth it so fast, that when they would be gon they leave both it and part of their entralls which are fastned to it. *Aculeum apibus natura dedit ventri consertum/*. \Nat.hist.I.II.c.18/ If they light upon poultry although their desire be to the quicke, if they can quicklie come at it, yet will they put forth their speers as soone as they touch the feather; and if they chance to hit the hard part thereof the sting sticketh fast, as in the skin: and therefore goose wings are naught to be used in the hiving of Bees. *v/*. \v.c.5.n.45./ 
[cw: Like-]

=== 

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$

Likewise if they light upon the hair of your head or beard, (save only when they come home loden, or the weather is colde) they wil sting if they can reach the skin, \24 *Woole and wollen do not offend them./*/ although woole and wollen do not offend them: & if being otherwise angered they strike their speeres in woollen, they can easily pul them out againe: \25 *Fustian leather, & velvet naught among Bees./*/ But the nap of new fustian displeaseth them, because it seems hairy, and the stuffe is so fast, that it holdeth the sting. Wherefore such apparel is not fit among Bees: as also lether in gloves or otherwise, for assone as they touch it they wil strike, if they bee any whit mooved, and their speeres they cannot recover againe. Velvet in facing of hats or elsewhere doth anger them as much as any thing, making them strike assone as they touch it: but it hath not power to hold their speere. \26 *The Bees in their anger aime at the head./*/ When they are angrie their aime is most commonly at the head, and chiefly about the eies as knowing that there they may do most harme, for that part swelleth most and longest: and yet I never heard that anie ever stung the very eie, as if they were forbidden to touch that tender part. But the bare hande that is not very hairy, they will seldome or never sting, unlesse they be much offended.
\27 *When any is stung the company must be one/*/ When you are stung, or any in the company, yea though a Bee have striken but your clothes, specially in hot wether, you were best be packing as fast as you can: for the other Bees smel-

ling the rancke favour of the poison cast out with the sting wil come about you as thicke as haile: so that fitly and lively did he expresse the multitude & fiercenes of his enimies that said *They came about me like Bees./* Then is there no way to appease them but flight, the more you resist the fiercer they are. They are like unto incorrigible shrews: there is no dealing with them but by patience, though when they sting they are sure to have the worst. \28 *The Bees have the worst when they sting/*/ For the wound endangereth nether life nor limb: two nights sleepe will take awaie the swelling, and two minutes the paine (unlesse it be in verie reumatik or humorous bodies: of which sorte I have knowne some so swollen and disfigured with that little stroke, that you could scarce knowe them by their favour in five or six daies after.) \29 *They loose their sting and entrals & consequently their lives/*/ But on the other side, whereas the waspe, hornet, and dorre, do sting often without any hurt to themselves, the Bee never stingeth but once and then shee leaveth hir speere and entrals more or lesse behinde her, *animamque in vulnere ponit./* \*Virg. Georg./* Hist.an.l9.c40./ *(Intereunt quæ percusserint, quoniam fine intestins eruptione aculeus eximi non potest)./* For within fowre and twentie howres after, or, if much of his entrals come forth with the sting, within halfe that time shee dieth: \30 *The speere of it selfe pearceth deeper when the Bee is gon./*/ But the speere reteining life when the Bee is gone, if it be not presentlie pulled out, will worke it selfe into the flesh up to the hard end, & so cause the paine

and swelling to bee both greater and longer. 
\31 *How to prevent the paine and swelling/*/ Therefore when you are stung, instantlie wipe of the Bee, sting and all, & wash the place with your spittle: so shal you prevent both paine & swelling, which otherwise nothing but time can cure: for the posion is so subtill that it quicklie pierceth the flesh, \32 *Nothing but time can cure their stinging/*/ and the wound so little that no antidote can followe after: and yet I have heard commended for a remedie the joice of houseleeke, of rue, of malows, of ivie, of a marigold leafe, of holyhock and vinegar, of sault & vineger, and divers other things. 

\33 *what things the Bee-master must avoid/*/ But if thou wilt have favour of thy Bees that they sting thee not, thou must avoid such things as offend them: thou must not be (1) unchast or (2) uncleanly: for impurity & sluttishness (themselves being most chast and neate,) they utterly abhorre: thou must not come among them (3) smelling of sweat, or having a stinking breath caused either through eating of leekes, onions, garleeke, and the like; or by any other meanes: the noisomnes whereof is corrected with a cup of beere, and therefore it is not good to come among them before you have drunk thou must not be given to (4) surfeting & drunkennes: thou must not come (5) puffing & blowing or sweating unto them, nether hastily stirre among them, nor violently defend thy

\35. *Safer to walke then stand among Bees/*/ At any time, when nothing hath angered them one may boldly walke along by your Bees: but if he stand still before them within the space of a pearch in the heate of the day, it is marvaile but one or other spying him from the hive wil have a cast at him. 
\36 *The fittest time to stirre about Bees is in the morning/*/ If you have any thing to doe about your hives, the fittest time is in the morning, before the sun be hot, or otherwise in cold, wet, or windie wether, for then they will not sting, unlesse they be much provoked. They are also very gentle in the evenings; but then being wearie if you stand in their way you trouble their lighting, and cause them to fall, & if you make them come forth when they are housed for al night, they can hardly see to get in againe. *v./* \*v.n./*41/

they are soone angrie, and very eager. \38 *How to bee armed when the Bees are angrie/*/ Wherefore if at such time, you have occasion to trouble them, or to come among them being already chased, cover your face with cipres or boulter, having a handkerchiefe betweene it and your forehead to beare it out from the skin, & your hat on your head to hold it fast, so shall you save your face and yet see what you doe: & if they be so earnest, that you feare stinging your hands, put on a paire of wollen gloves, & so are you armed at all points.
\39 *Bees dangerous to cattaile./*/ Unto cattale which have not reason by flight or otherwise to save themselves they are more dangerous. A horse in the heate of the day looking over a hedge, on the other side whereof was a staule of Bees, while hee stood nodding with his head, as his maner is, because of the flies, the Bees fell upon him and killed him. Likewise I heard of a teeme that stretching against a hedge overthrew a staule on the other side, and so two of the horses weree stung to death. I doubt not but through negligence many mischances have happened elsewhere. For this thing hath beene long since observed by that great philosopher. *Necant/* (saith he) *vel maxima animalia ictu sui aculei: jam equus occisus ab apibus est./* \Arist.hist.an.l.9.c.40/

*animum, artem quis facile crediderit./* \41 *their sight dim./*/ Of all the senses their sight seemeth to be weakest: and weaker when they come home loaded, then when they are leere, and being loaded weaker on foot then when they are flying. If when they come home loaded, they light beside the dore, they will goe up and downe seeking for it, as if they were in the darke: & unlesse by chance they hit upon it, they must fly againe before they can finde it. As many as fall beside the stoole when it waxeth darke, ten to one they ly abroad all night: yea if at such time being troubled by any thing they come forth from the stoole, though then they be fresh and lusty they wil leape up and downe, runne and fly to and fro til they be wearie; but by no meanes can they finde the way in againe. And therefore is it that when they fly abroad, they take such paines at the doore in rubbing and wiping their glazen eies, that they may the better discerne their way forth and back. 
\42 *The smelling very quick./*/ But their smelling is excellent, whereby, when they fly aloft in the aier, they wil quickly perceave any thing under them that they like, as hony or tarre, though it be covered: as soone as the honi-dew is falen, they presently winde it, though the Okes that receive it *v./* \*V.c.6.n/*.38/ be a far of which the Poet, speaking of the excellencie of some creatures in this sense before others, doth thus expresse

And by this sense they finde out any strange Bee, which is not otherwise to be knowne from their owne company, & that in the dark hive: where, when they are disposed, they will by the same meanes cull out the drones, yea and pull out the cephens that are shut up in the cells, not medling with an of their own sex. 
\43 *Hearing & feeling/*/ Their heareing and feeling are very quicke. If you touch their hives but lightly, they presentlie perceiving it, make a generall noise: although \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40/ *Aristotle/* doubt whether they heare, or not. *Quanquam incertum est an audiant./* But if they did not heare, to what purpose is that musicke made in the hives, before the swarming? *v.c. 5. n 23./*
\44 *Tasting/*/ And of their fift sense I make no question, sithens they are used to things of so different tasts although there may seeme the lesse use of it, because their smelling is so perfect.
\45 *Their virtues/*/ And such are their outward senses. The inward faculties of thier mindes are farre more excellent. \46. *Fortitude/*/ In valour and magnanimitie they surpasse all creatures: there is nothing so huge and mightie that they feare to set upon, and when they have once begunne, they are invincible: for nothing can make them yeeld but death: so great hearts doe they carrie in so little bodies.

But above all, one excellent skill they have which the most excellent femals, though much they desire it, must yeeld themselves to want: for they knowe certainelie when they breed a male, and when a female: which thing appeareth by this, that they laie their cephen-feedes in a wide combe by them selves, *v./* \v.c.6.n.8./ and the Nymph-seedes in the rest, which are of a smaller size. *v./* \v.c.6.n.7.

If I should relate the storie al men, I knowe, would not beleeve it; not withstanding because every man maie make some use of it, you shall have it. 
\48 *A strange tale concerning the knowledge & devotion of Bees./*/ A certain simple woman having some stals of Bees which yeelded not unto hir desired profit, but did consume & die of the murraine; made her mone to another woman more simple then hir selfe: who have her councel to get a consecrated host or round Godamighty and put it among them. According to whose advise she went to the priest to receive the host: which when she had done, she kept it in hir mouth, & being come home againe she tooke it out and

$*and of their Queene./*/$

put it into one of hir hives. Whereupon the murraine ceased, and the hony abounded. The woman therefore lifting up the hive at the due time to take out the honie, sawe there (most strange to be seene) a chappel built by the Bees with an altar in it, the wals adorned by marvelous skil of architecture with windowes conveniently set in their places: also a dore and a steeple with bels. And the host being laid upon the altar, the bees making a sweet noise flew around it. \Tho.Bozius de signis Eccles.lib.14.c.3./
But whether this doe more argue the supernatural knowledge and skil of the Bees, or the miraculous power of the host, or the spiritual craftines of him, whose comming is by the working of Satan with al power and signes and lying wonders, it may be some wil make a question: and presuming to examin every particular circumstance over narrowly, wil make objections against the truth of the story: which, by their leaves, in the behalfe of my author I must not spare to answere. First it may be that they wil object that the host being held so long in the womans mouth could not choose in that space but melt and marre. Indeed, if it did remaine, as it was, a wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but being turned into flesh it is an absurd assertion. If they shal say that because, it was now honi-harvest, at which time good stals, such as this was, are ful of wax and hony, that therefore

there could not be roome enough for a chapel with a steeple and bels in it; I answere that this is as weake and simple as the former. For seeing it is knowne that a blacke smith of London did make a locke and key so little that a flie could draw it; why should not the little smith of Nottingham (whose art is thought to excel al art of man) frame a little chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they wil reply, if we grant you this, howe then could the Bees flie about the altar in that little chappel, seeing they are not able to flie in so narrow a roome as the empty hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: happily the woman said they did but crawle. If they shal aske how the woman could see the altar with the host standing in the chancel & the bels hanging in the steeple, seeing the waxen wals were not transparent, they maie easilie thinke that the Bees would give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if they shal say that those bels being made of such metall would give but a weake sounde when they were runge to matins; they must consider the parishoners dwelt not far of. And so I thinke these captious criticks wil hold themselves satisfied. 
Unto this storie my author immediately addeth an other, like unto it, and as likely: how certaine theeves having stollen the silver boxe wherein the wafer-Gods use to lie, & finding [cw:one]

one of them there, being loath, belike, that he should lie abroad all night, did not cast him away, but laid him under a hive: whom the Bees acknowledging advanced to an high roome in the hive, and there in steede of his silver boxe made him an other of the whitest wax & when they had so done, in worshippe of him, at set howres they sung most sweetly beyond al measure about it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight with a light and al. Wherewith the bishop being made acquainted, came thither with many others: & lifting up the hive he saw there neere the top a most fine box, wherein the host was laid, and the quires of Bees singing about it, and keeping watch in the night, as Monkes do in their cloisters. The bishop therefore taking the host caried it with the greatest honour into the church: whether many resorting were cured of innumerable diseases. 
I doubt not but some incredulous people wil quarrel this story as wel as the former, making question since the combs in the top of the hive are not past halfe an inch one from an other, how there could bee roome for a box of that breadth that would containe the host, & then being there, how it might be seene by the Bishoppe, seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees, and the story saith that they were then singing about it: and therefore perhaps they wil suspect the whole narration, supposing

it rather to be an unadvised devise of some idle monk, which, if he had consulted with them that have skil among Bees, might have made his tale more probable. Alleadging moreover that therefore there is no mention made of my particular person, time, or place, least the circumstances should disprove the matter it selfe. All which objections I could as easily answere as the former, if I thought it needful. But now because some may bee as ready to mistrust my relation, as others are to object against the truth of the stories, I wil here in mine owne behalfe for their satisfaction set downe in my authors owne words. 
*Cum mulier quædam simplicis ingenii nonnulla apum aluearia possideret, neque illæ redderent expectitum fructum, sed lue quadam tabescentes morerentur: de consilio alterius fœminæ simplicioris, accessit, ad sacerdotem perceptura eucharistiam: quam sumptam tamen ore continuit, domumque reversa extractam collocavit in uno ex alveariis.

The conclusion, which my author necessarily inferreth hereupon, is better then all the rest. *Ex his necesse est dicamus in Eucharistia verum C. corpus esse./* But if thou wilt grant me that hereby is proved the incredible knowlesge & skill of the Bees, for my part I wil urge thee no farther.

But indeed I cannot much commend their justice towards strangers, for all that they can catch is their owne: unlesse they may bee excused in this respect, that the Bees of divers hives are at deadly feud, or rather as kingdomes, that are at defiance one with another. *v.c.7.n.23./*

\53 *The age of Bees/*/ Anent the age of Bees there are divers opinions: some thinke that they may live 4, or 5 yeares, yea some 6, or 7. \Georg. 4 Hist.l.5.c.22/ (*neque enim plus septima ducitor æstas.

#CHAP. 2/#

\*Of 5 things requisit in a bee garden, the first is that it be night at hand/*/ 
{F}Or your bee-garden first choose some plot nigh your home, that the Bees may be in sight & hearing, because of swarming, fighting, or other sodaine happe, wherein they may need your presente helpe. 
Your garden of herbes & flowres is fit for the purpose. *Hortis coronamentisque, maxime alvearia & apes conveniunt; res præcipus quæstus compendiique cum favit./* \Nat.hist.li.21.c.12./
\2. *That it be safely fenced from cattaile and windes./*/ See it be safe, and surely fenced, not online from al cattaile (which if they breake in maie quickelie spoile both the Bees & themselves) and specially from swine (which by rubbing against the hives, and tearing the hacles in a wantonnes are most apt to overthrow the stalles) but also from the violence of the windes, that when the Bees come laden and weary home, they maie settle quietlie. 
\3 *The north and east fences should be high/*/ The north-fence of your garden shoulde be close and high, that the cold winde of that coast, which blowing against the Bees coming

$*Of the placing of your stalls./*/$

home wearie would throwe downe & kill manie, maie be altogether kept from them. And therefore, if it maie be, set your Bees on the south side of your house; which will not onlie defend them from that unholesome winde, but also by reflection double the heate of the sun shining on the wal, & so comfort them much, speciallie in the winter and spring. 
The east fence also would be good & high to keepe from the Bees as well the sun, as the winde. For the sun rising doth oftimes till thenceforth, when the aire is colder then they can indure; and the East wind being cold and sharpe is verie unkind for Bees, speciallie in the spring. 
\4 *The south & west fences must be also good but not so high as to hide the sun from the hives./*/But in no wise let the place be shadowed from the south-sun: for that doth not onlie dry the hives & relieve the Bees in the winter and spring, but also causeth them to swarme in summer, if it be not extreame hot and drie *v./* \*v.c./*5.n.19./
Nor yet from the sun setting: because in calme and pleasant weather the Bees wil be in field after the sun is down, even as long as they can there see: and if they returne, they finde it darke at home, manie of them; their sight being but dim, *v/*. \C.I.n.41/ fall short or wide: which flying and running to and fro til they be wearie, at length yeeld to the cold dew.

other: yet are they no lesse violent, and more frequent: so that they also do much harme, specially in the spring. \5 *In rough winds Bees need a skreene./*/ And therefore if at that time of the yeare in rough & boisterous winds you find that the garden-fences doe not sufficiently garde and defend them; then it is good to set up wixed or lined hurdles, or some other skreene betweene them and the weather. For though they can shift abroad in the strongest windes, as a ship that has sea-roome; yet are they easily overthrowne at the hive, as the ship is soone wrecked at the haven. 
\6 *That it be sweet/*/ 3. That the place be sweete, not annoyed with any stinking savour. I have knowne a stall in the spring being sufficiently provided of hony, & having bred yong, to forsake all because of poultry that roosted in a tree over them. \Nat.hist.li.II.c.18./ *Odere fœdes odores, proloque, fugiut/*: And yet the smel of urin doth not offend them; nay they wil be very busy where it is shed. It is thought they use it for physike. *Remedium contra alui concitationem est urina hominum vel boum./*
\7 *Neither very cold in winter nor over hot in sommer/*/ 4 That it be neither very cold in winter nor very hot in sommer. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Locus æstate non fervidus, hyeme tepidus./* A bare flower is naught in both seasons: because in winter it is over cold and by that meanes quickly chilleth the Bees that light upon it; and in sommer it causeth them to lie forth through excessive heate, *v./* \v.c.5.n.19./ A grassie ground therefore is best at all times: but let it

be kept notte in summer & dry in winter; \8 *A grassie ground is best kept not and drie/*/ for long grasse and weedes about the hive doe but harbour the bees enimies, *v./* \v.c.7.n.4&18/ and hinder both their passage in and out, and their rising againe when they fall short: and water, if it stand, not only maketh the place drie and fowle, but also causeth mustines within, and increaseth the colde without: both which are noisome to the Bees. 
\9 *Beset with trees and bushes/*/ 5 That it be conveninently be set with trees & bushes fit to receive the swarmes, as plumtrees, cheritrees, apletrees, filberds, hazels, thornes, roses, &c. Although, if they be willing to stay, they will not refuse a dead hedge, a lavender border, or the like, or sometimes the bare ground. For want of trees, some have stucke up greene boughs, and the Bees have lighted upon them. 
\10 *Two sorts of seates/*/ The place being thus fitted, the seates are to be provided: which, whether they be stools or benches, must be set a little shelving, that the raine may neither run into the hive, nor stay at the dore. 
\11 *The benches not so good as single stooles./*/ To set many stals upon a bench (as many use to do) is not best: for that in sommer it may cause the bees to fight, as having easie accesse on foot to each other, and standing so neere that they shall sometime mistake the next hive for their own: & in winter the bench wil be alwaies wet, which looseth the cloome, 
[cw: rotteth]

$*and of their seates./*/$

rotteth the bottome of the hive, & offendeth the bees: and the mouse at all times hath free passage from one to an other, without feare.
\12 *Swarmes may be set on benches/*/ The single stooles therefore are best. And yet it is not amisse to set most of your swarms upon benches, before the old stals: from whence remove them to the stooles, when the stals are taken: and then set up the benches til an other yeere. 
\13 *Wooden stooles better than they of stone./*/ The best stoooles are of wood: those of stone are too hote in hot weather, & (which is worse) too cold in cold. 
\14 *The size of stooles/*/ For their size they shoulde not bee above halfe an inch or an inch without the hive: save only before where there needeth the space of five or *6./* inches, that the Bees may have roome enough to light upon, specially then, when the sight of a rainy clowd sendeth them thronging home. Three inches of which fore-part next the hive must remaine flat for the porch to stand upon *v./* \v.c.3.n.25/ the rest is to be cut shelving that it may the better avoid the raine. And therfore if the hive be 15. inches over, the stoole shoulde not be abive 16. or 17. inches one way, and 21. or 22. at the most the other way. 
\15 *Which was the stooles should be set/*/ These stooles would be set toward the south or rather southwest, that the hive may somwhat breake the East-winde from the dore, *v./* \v.not.3./ and that the dore may be lightened by the sun setting when they returne late from field. *v./* \v.not.4/

$*Of the placing of your stalls./*/$

\16 *How neere to the fence/*/ And if the north fence be a wal, pale, or hedge, let them stande some two feet from the fence that you may go about the hives to see & mend what is amisse: but if it be a house-side, then set them 2. feet without the evesdropping, lest the raine rebounding from the gutter moisten the hives. 
\17 *How neere to each other./*/ They should also stand in straight rankes or rewes from east to west 4 feet, or at the least 3. feet and a halfe from one another measuring from dore to dore, not only that you may have roome enough to go rounde about every one, but also that the Bees when they come back home in hast, specially when a swarme goeth backe againe, may al fly into their own hive. For if they stand neere togither, at such a time many wil take the next hive for their own, and then they fal togither by the eares, *v./* \*V.c.5.n.55/*/ & the nymphs also, when they go first abroad, wil by that occasion the sooner mistake: which if they doe, they die. Neverthelesse if the swarmes upon the benches stand but 2. feet apart, it is enough: but alwaies lay a Rest, *v./* \*V.c.n.39/*/ or other sticke of three inches thicke, as marches betweene them to keepe the peace. 
The ranks should bee placed sixe or seaven feete, or five at the least one before another, that so not only the Bees, but the sun also may come without let to every hive. 
\18 *How neere to the ground./*/ Also they should not stande above two feet

from ground because of the winde; nor under one foot for the dampnes of the ground in winter, which would make the hives moist & mustie; and for the heat of the ground in sommer, which in hote and dry wether would make the Bees lie out, and so hinder both their worke & swarminge. *v/* \V.c.5.n.19./
If you have but one ranke, the best highth is one foot and a halfe. If you have many, it is convenient that the most northward rankes stand highest, & the most southward lowest, descending by degrees from two feet to one: as if there be two rews of stooles let the first stand 2. feete from ground, the next 18 inches, and all the benches one foote. If there be three rankes beside the benches, let the second be twenty inches, and the third sixteene. 
\19 *How to bee footed/*/ The stone-stooles must bee footed as they may, the fashion of each place where they are used wil direct you. But the plankes or wooden stooles are either to have fowre feete made of the hart of oak, or of some other lasting wood; or to be fastned to one foote with two wooden pins: which foor let me made of sound timber 5 or 6 inches over; and of that length that it may be set betweene fifteene and eighteene inches in the ground. The fower feet are fittest for the higher stooles, and the single foote for the lower.

#*Of the hives, and the dressing of them./*/#
##CHAP. 3./##
\1 *Two sorts of hives./*/ {I}N some countries they use strawne hives bound with briar: in some wicker hives made of privet, withy, or hazell, dawbed usually with cowcloome tempered with gravelly dust or sand or ashes.
\2 *Strawne-hives with their inconveniences & remedies./*/ The strawne hives when they are olde and loded, unlesse they be very hard wrought, doe usually sinke on one side, specially if they take wet, and so breake the combes and let out the hony: and the nether part of them is apt to be rotted with the moisture of the stoole: For which cause it is good to reare them an inch from the stoole with three strong spleetes, equally distant, and thrust into the bottome toward the top as high as you can, alwaies keeping them in the middle of the rowles: and so shal you also prevent that other inconvenience, & keepe the hives upright. 
\3 *Wicker-hives with their inconvenineces & remedies./*/ The wicker hives wil still be at fault, and lie open, if they be not often repaired, unto wasps, robbers, and mise. Any of these, if shee find but 
[cw: a lit-]

$*and the dressing of them/*/$

a little chap, will dig hir way in: and the mouse (unlesse the twigs bee close wrought) though shee find none. 
Both these hives, if they be not wel covered, are subject to wet, which maketh them mustie, and, if it be much, rotteth the combes and destroieth the Bees. But the heate in summer, the colde in winter, and the raine at all times doth soonest pearce the wicker hives: for which cause it is good to double-dawbe them.
\4 *Strawnhives best./*/ All things considered the strawne hives are better, specially for smal swarmes.
\5 *The size of hives./*/ The hives should conteine betweene a bushel and a halfe, as the time of the yeare, and quantitie of the swarme doth require: how to fit the hives to the swarmes see *c./*5 *n./*37.
Have alwaies hives enough of al sizes in store, least they be to seeke when you should use them.
\6 *When hives are to be made./*/ The  best time for making of them, whether they be strawn or wicker, is in the three dead months of winter *Saggit. Capricorn./*& *Aquar. v./*  \*v.n./*51/ for then the straw, briars, & twigges are best in season. 
\7 *How hives are to be dressed before they receive the swarmes./*/ Your hive being ready is thus to be dressed. First cut awaie all those staring strawes, twigs or other offensive ragges that are fast in the hive, making the inside as smooth as may be: but first (specially if it be a strawn hive) rub it a good round about with a linnen cloath, that so \8 *The pruning of hives/*/ [cw: you] [C4]

===

$*Of the hives/*/$
you may the sooner remove those that ar loose. For these obstacles, if they cause not the Bees to forsake the hive, yet will they much trouble and hinder them: you may heare them, (specially in the night) scraping and gnawing three or fowr daies after they be hived, yea sometime a week together, as though there were mise in the hive. And in strawn hives, if you help them not, a long time after.
\9 *The spraying or spleeting of them./*/ 2. Then take a straight hazel or willow-stick and quarter it, if it be big enough, otherwise slit it: and then shave and smooth the cleaftes; which being of a convenient strength & length put three of them in a hive, setting the upper endes together in the top of the hive, and the nether ends equally distant one from an other within a handfull of the bottome. But if the hive be more then fourteene inches over within, it may wel receive foure spleets. And this is the easiest & quickest way of spleeting a hive: it is also strong enough for bearing the combs, and best for taking them forth without breaking. Besides which there are divers sortes of spleeting, needlesse to be rehearsed: for every country hath his fashion. 
\10 *The seasoning of them./*/ 3 Lastly in swarming time season the hives that you meane to use, rubbing them with sweete herbes such as the Bees love, as time, savourie, majoram, baulme, fenell, hysop, malowes, charlock, &c. And when the swarme is [cw: setled]

===

$*and the dressing of them/*/$

settled, take the hive that you thinke fit for it in bignesse, *v./* \*V.c.5.n./*37./ and with a branch of hazel, oake, willow, or any of the foresaid herbes, but chiefly with a sprig of that tree whereon the swarme lighted, wipe the hive cleane, and then dipping it into meth, or faire water mixed with a little hony, or with milke and salt, or for a need with salt only besprinkle the same.
\11 *The seasoning of an old hive./*/ But if the hive have beene used before, after you have pared away the wax as cleane as may be, if you thinke the former dressing will not make it sweete enough, then let a hogge eate 2 or 3 handfuls of mault, or pease, or other corne in the hive: mean while doe you so turne the hive, that the fome or froth, which the hogge maketh in eating, may goe all about the hive. And then wipe the hive lightly with a linnen cloath, and so will the Bees like this hive better than a new. But if you use it not the same day, then besprinkle it also, when you doe use it, as is shewed before. And so serve a new hive when the Bees are so froward, that they will not otherwise abide. 
\12 *How hives are to be ordered when the Bees are in them./*/ And thus are the hives to be prepared and dressed, before they receive the Bees. Now will I shew you how they are afterward to be ordered throughout the yeare.
\13 *The hives alwaies well hacled./*/ 1. First let them be alwaies wel covered, that they may be safe in summer from heat, lest, the wax melting, the combes fal down; *v./* \*V.c./* 7. *n./* 49./ in winter from [cw: cold] 

$*Of the hives/*/$

cold, least it kil the Bees; *v/* \*v.c./*7.*n./*51./ and at al times from raine, least it corrupt first the hive, afterward the combes, and at last the Bees also. *v./* \*v.c./* 7 *n/* 54/
\14 *How to make a hacle. /*/ The best cover for hives is a thicke hacle: *Alvearia stramento operiri utilissimum./* Which is thus to bee made. Take fowre or five handfuls of wheat or rie leased out of the sheafe: which being bound up severally beat out the corne; & then casting away their bands draw out the eares of each handfull longer on the one side then on the other: and putting the long sides togither (so to make the forme of a taper or pyramis for shooting the raine) binde them al in one under the eares as fast as you can, with a thong, cord, or other strong string. 
\15 *The working of the cap/*/ And then, to make a band or cap for this pyramis or head of your hacle, lease out of the sheafe almost a handfull of the strongest straw, and lay it in soake about a quarter of an howre. Being thus prepared take out of that wet bundel some 40. or 50. reedes or strawes, and laying halfe of them one way and halfe the other, that the band may be of equall bignes, take them up togither; and then mingling one end of the reeds with the middle reeds of the head, and twisting them fast togither in your hand, let the band harle or double in the very top of the head: and so begin to binde the head round, working downeward, and stil twisting the band as you go. When those reedes are wel-nigh wrought up, take out of the wet [cw: bundle] 

===

$*and the dressing of them/*/$

bundle so many more prepared as before: and when you have mingled one end thereof with the end of the other, holding them in your hand twist them fast togither: and so continue your worke, alwaies binding as hard as you can, and bearing up every role close to his fellow. When you are come downe to the string, loose it, and binde the last or lowest role in the place thereof, making fast the end, by forcing it up betweene the head and the cap with a forked sticke and a mallet. 
\16 *The bignesse of the hacle./*/ The hacle thus made of fowre or five handfuls wil conteine in compasse close under the cap betweene 14. and 18. inches: fourteene wil serve for the smaller hives, & eighteene for the greatest, although they be five feet about. 
\17 *The length of it./*/ For the length of the hacles, each one is to be fitted to his hive, so that the skirts thereof may reach to the stoole, or within halfe an inch of it round about, save only the space of fowre or five inches on each side the dore, where it must be pared somewhat shorter, that the Bees passage be not hindered. \18 *The girdle./*/ And then with a smal pliant girdle of bethwin, or the like gird the hacle close to the hive in the middle or biggest part of it, least the winde disorder it. If there be any crook or bout in the girdle, set that before, that the hacle, bearing in that place farther out, may shoot the water from the dore: otherwise, for that purpose, set the girdle from what high- [cw: er] 

=== 

$*Of the hives/*/$

er before then behinde. 
\19 *The hives alwaies close cloomed/*/ Next keepe the hives alwaies close for defence of the bees against their enimies. The best cloome for that purpose is made of neates dunge: *circumlini alveos fimo bubulo utilissimum/*: \Nat hist. li 21. cap. 14./ but let it be tempered and hardened with clay or other morter, or for a neede with ashes, against the wet; and with sand or gravel against the gnawing of Mise. With this cloome close up the skirts and brackes of your hives, that there be no way into them but only by the dores.
\20 *Then seldome to be moved./*/ And being thus safely shut, move them not without urgent occasion. *v./* \*V.n./* 33.44.*&/* c.8.*&/*9/ for often lifting up the hive and letting in the open aire doth discourage the stall. \21 *How a hive lifted up is to bee put downe again/*/ But whensoever you are occasioned to do (the Bees being stirring) lest any be crushed betweene the skirts & the stoole in setting it downe againe, teele up one side with a little tile-sharde, which, when the Bees are quiet, take away, & see the hive close cloomed againe. 
\22. *The bignes of the hive dore./*/ The hive-dore must be made as little as may be, the Bees having easie passage to & fro, not letting one an other: and therfore great flights must have the greater dores, and little flightes the lesse.  The greater dores may contein about 4. square inches, as being 4. inches wide, & one inch, or at the least three quarters of an inch high: the lesse need be but 3. inches wide.
Unto the hive-dore there belong a barre, a [cw: porch]

===

$*and the dressing of them./*/$
porch, and a porch-dore: which for the safety of the Bees are to be used in their times, as anon in this chapter shal be shewed.
\23 *The making of the barre./*/ The barre is to be made of a piece of lath, trencher, or other thin wood an inch broad, & fowre inches long: in the nether edge whereof you must cut a holownes 3 inches long & almost halfe an inch high, so leaving halfe an inch at each ende uncut. And this will serve for most stalls: but if you have any so good, that they can not, easilie or without let, passe through this single barre; then for them cut an other holownesse above, of the former length, and but one quarter of an inch high, leaving the space betweene the two passages a quarter of an inche. The forme of which barres both single & double you may see in these figures. 

{Diagram or pattern}

\24 *The use of it/*/ The use of the barre is to streighten the passage where there needeth not so much roome, & to keep out the enimie when the porch is from it. *v./* \*V.n./*33/ [cw: The]

$*Of the hives/*/$

\25 *The making of the porch./*/ The concavitie or holownesse of the porch must be an inch in length or widenes from east to west, almost halfe an inch in heighth, and an inch and a halfe and better in thicknes from the hive outward. And it is to be made of a piece of wood two inches long, one inch high, & two inches thicke: of the which two inches, an inch and a halfe and a litle more must serve for the thicknesse of the concavitie: and the nether part of the rest being taken away, there must be a chanel cut in the upper part, in which the dore is to slide to and fro. The fashion of which porch you may best understand by the figure of one ende, thus represented. 

{Diagram}

Out of one square sticke, an inch one way and two inches the other & twenty in length, you may cut halfe a skore. For great swarmes and full stalls, which cannot easily passe through these porches, make them an inch and a halfe wide, and then the wood must bee two inches and a halfe long.
\26 *The use of it./*/ The porch having this long and streight passage, the theife will not be so hasty to enter, & if she doe, ten to one shee is met with before she can get through, and sent back againe with [cw: a]

\27 *The making of the porch-dore./*/ The porch-dore is to be made of a peice of thin wood, as a lath, trencher, chip, or the like: of the length of the porch, of that thicknesse that it may slide to and fro in the chanell, and of that breadth that it may reach from the stoole to the top of the chanell. In the middle cut a breathing place, so long as the widenesse of the porch, and so narrow that a Bee cannot passe. \28 *The use of it/*/ With this dore you may shut or halfe-shut the porch as you shall see cause. 
\29 *The greese./*/Unto these may be added a greese or ascent, which may be a planck or bord of the breadth of the stoole at least, and of that length that it may stand leaning from the ground to the forepart of the stoole; that thereon the Bees may settle when they come weary or thronging home, and so ascend to the dore, and that there they may sun & refresh themselves being chilly & wearie. It may also be made of two bords, the broader the better, or for a neede, of many lathes fastned together with 3 ledges, which, if they be outward, may save the Bees from falling when they misse their hold. 
\30 *How to order the Beehives in every month, & first in GEMINI./*/ From *Gemini/* to *Leo/* let the dores *v./* stand wide open, that there may bee roome for the [cw: swarmes]

If you see them once fighting, *v/* \*v.c./*7.*n/*31./ either presently take them, or make their entrance so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once: & before *Libra/* be sure to take them.

if you or the wether shut them in much longer, they wil bee so faint and feeble through their long restraint, that without very pleasant weather at their comming abroad, a number of them wil bee chilled while they rest themselves but a little in the open aire. And therefore as often as any pleasant day causeth you to set the hives open, let them alwaies so stand until the frost or snow keepe the Bees in againe. And after Saint Pauls day or mid-*aquarius/* shut them not, unles the snow lie, or the frost hold two or three daies togither.

\1 *The drone no labourer/*/{T}HE Drone, which is a grosse hive-bee without sting, hath been alwaies reputed for a sluggard, & that worthily: for howsoever he brave it with his round velvet cappe, his side gown, his great paunch, and his lowd voice: yet is he but an idle person living by the sweat of others brows. For he worketh not at al, ether at home or abroad, and yet spendeth as much as two labourers: you shal never find his maw without a good drop of the purest *nectar/*. In the heat of the day he flieth abroad, aloft, and about, and that with no small noise, as though he would doe some great act: but it is only for his pleasure, and to get him a stomach, and then returneth hee presently to his cheere. *Fuci cum exeunt efferunt sese fusium in sublimi gyroque volitant; quod ubi satis jam fecerint redeunt domum & epulis perfruuntur./* \Hist.li.9.c.40./ But for all this there is necessary use of him, that hee may not be spared, as without whom the Bee cannot be, For albeit be be not seen to ingender [cw:with]

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$

with the hony-bee, *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*50./ ether abroad, as other *insecta/* do, or within the hive, where yet you may by means behold what they do; *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n/*4.&5./ yet without doubte is hee the male-bee, by whose natural heat and masculine vertue the hony-bee, which breedeth both hony-bees & drones, *v./* \*v.n/*11.*&/*16/ secretly conceiveth. 
\3 *Divers reasons proving the drone to be the male. The first reason is, that they are suffered in breeding time only/*/ The reasons that moove me thus to thinke are these. First because although they be great wasters of the Bees store, yet until they begin to leave breeding, and have conceived for the next yeare, (which some do about *Leo/*, most before *Virgo/*) they suffer them afterward they begin to beat them away. Which if some few doe not, before *Scorpio/* they die naturally: and from thenceforth al the winter, until the Bees breed new againe, *v./* \*v.n./*16.&17./ there is not a drone to be had *In rerum natura/*. \Nat hist l.11. c 11./ \4 *No drone in winter./*/ When they are quite gone, then do the Bees lay no more seeds that yeere, but only hatch and breed up those that are already in the celles.
\5.*The second reason is that the drone being taken away in breeding time the Bees breed no more/*/ Secondly, as the rather and the more the drones are, the more & greater are the swarms, (*Corte quo major fuerit fucorum multitudo, eo major fiet examinum proventus v/*) \*v.c./*5 *n/*4./ so where the drones are few & late,there is smal increase & therefore if you kill the drones of a hive before the Bees have done swarming, and breeding (as some fondly have don before Midsomer, to save their hony from these greedy lur- [cw:chers]

$*and of the drone/*/$

chers) neither will the swarmes come forth that were formerly bred, nor the stocke thence forth breed any more. After which time bringing in *Ambrosia v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*17./ as much as before, and having no yong ones to spend part of it, nor taking any pleasure to worke it with the liquid *nectar/*, as otherwise they use to doe, *v/* \*v.c./*6.*n./*17/ they lay it up carelesly in their cells, where it corrupteth & turneth to stopping *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n/*18. & 19./ which will cause them so much to mislike their hive, that the next *Virgo/* they will easily yeeld it to the robbers *v./* \*V.c./*7*n/*23/ And if by your industry they be then preserved, in *Pisces/* when breeding time is, finding themselves barren, and therefore loathing even themselves and all, they yeeld their goods to them that wil take it: & after a while, when the strange Bees and they smel all alike by being togither in the same hive, & sucking the same hony, away they goe with them to their drones. But every faire day they will returne to fetch that they left behind them : you may see them flying so thicke to and fro that hive, as if it were full of Bees: but when night comes, they are all gone. 
\6. *The third reason is that they are bred by the Bees/*/ Thirdly because *omne simile generat sibi simile/* Every living thing doth breed male, or female of his kind, and experience doth teach us that the Bees doe breed as well drones as honi bees *v./* \*v.n./*16/ seeing the honi-bees are femals, it followeth necessarily that the drones are the males of the [cw:same] 
 
===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$

\Hæc apis [greek and hebrew]/ same kind. And therefore not only in the Greek and Latine, but also in the first language, wherein names were given to things according to their natures, the honi-bee hath hir feminine appellation, as the drone his masculine. 
\7 *The fourth reason is that the wasp & dorres have drones which are their males/*/ Fourthly wee see the like in the likest *insecta/* the waspe and the dorre: for the manifesting whereof I wil briefly shew you the breeding of them both. 
\8 *The breeding of wasps by drones/*/ The wasps nest is begun by one great wasp which you may therfore cal the mother-wasp: the which in *Cancer/* (or in hote and dry springs somewhat rather) within some hoale, usuallie made in the ground by a Moule, Mouse, or other meanes, worketh a combe, in forme of a round tent hanging by the top to the over part of the hoale. This combe containeth about six celles of the bignes & fashion of the Bees cells, wherein shee breedeth so many young ones: which, when they are fledge, do breed as well as their dam: and so enlarge the combe to some eight inches over. Then making more roome beneath by moining & carrying out the earth, they hang an other combe under the first, by little pins, and so an other, and an other, increasing stil in the same place til sommer bee done. For they goe not forth in swarmes as Bees doe. \His l.9.c.42/ *Missio ut apum nulla vel crabronum vel vesparum fieri solet: sed qui subinde oriantur novelli ibidem ma/* [cw:*nent/*] 

===

$*and of the Drone./*/$
*nent, & alveum terra egestæ faciunt ampliorem./* In their last brood, which is in *Scorpio/*, besides the smal or ordinary waspes, they have also two other sorts, drones or male-waspes (which are somewhat bigger then the smal wasps, & without stings as the drone Bees) & mother wasps, which are like the smal ones in al respectes save that they are twise so bigge. These when they are fledge having conceived, as the Bees, by the drones, leaving both drones and smal waspes to the mercy of the winter (which with the next cold-wet wether chilleth and killeth them as they flie abroad) do forthwith betake themselves to some warme place, as the thatch of an house, a mortice in a post, an auger-hoale, or the like: where they abide til the next spring without any meate, as it were in a dead sleepe: out of the which neverthelesse a little warmth of the fire, or of your hande will awake them at anie time. At the blowing of a palme, if the weather be warme, they fly abroad for food: and at *Cancer/*, as I have said, they begin to nestle and breede. He that killeth one of them killeth a whole nest of waspes. 
And that the drone-waspes are the males, some were of opinion in the daies of *Aristotle/* for thus he writeth. \His.li.9.41./ *Si vespam ex pedibus ceperis bombilareque, siveris, advolant quæ aculeo carent, quod non faciunt, quæ aculeatæ sunt. Itaque argumento quidam hoc utuntur quod alteræ mares sunt, alteræ fœ-/* [cw:*minæ/*]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$

*minæ/* which argument seemeth not unprobable, seeing the fowlers counterfeiting the cal of the hen-quailes catch only the cockes.
\9.*The breeding of Dorrs by drones./*/ The dorre likewise beginneth hir neast single, being more like the Bee then the wasp is in that she maketh hony, and more unlike in the fashion of her combs: for she hath only a few round cells of the bignesse of grapes lying flat on the ground one upon another without any order: the which are made after this maner. First ether upon the ground in the grasse, or in some shallow hoale within the ground, she prepareth a little stuffe which is soft like wax, but browne and more brittle, of the bignesse of hir head; & therein she layeth about six or seaven seedes together compassing them round with the same stuffe: which increaseth by little and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to live, it groweth into so many severall cells, as there are grubs, each one having one to himselfe. When they become to their bignes, the celles, which before were browne and brittle, do now wax white and tough that you can scarce teare them. And when the dorres are ripe they gnaw their way out at the toppe. Upon these they make more in like manner, and the voide open celles they fil with hony, wherewith they feede both themselves and their yong when the weather suffreth them not to flie abroad. All this neast is covered with a little mosse like a birds-neast. [cw: Until]

===

$*and of the drone./*/$

Untill *Virgo/* they breede females only as the waspes doe and then last of all for propagation of their kinde they breed their drones, being likewise, as the drones of Bees & waspes, without stings. And these, to put the matter out of doubt, within a while after do openly engender with their females, as the chaffers doe. After which time the females breed no more till the next sommer, though you may see them gathering, and flying about somewhat longer then the waspes. In *Saggit/*: they betake themselves to their winter-rest, where they lie single as the mother waspe in a sleepe or swivet. But the drone-dorres, as the drone wasps, are destroied by the wether: not one afterwarde to be seene till *Virgo/*, when the females breed new againe. But one thing in the dorres & waspes is more strange then in the Bees. For whereas the Bees assone as they have bred their first broode of females, doe presently breede drones, *v./* \*v.n./*16/ both which, when they are ripe multiply togither; the young dorres and waspes in the beginning of sommer do not immediately take the drones (for then there are none) but receive from their da?s togither with their nature & being that masculine seed, wherby when they are ripe they breed likewise conceive by their late-bred drones for the next yeare, both for themselves and the yong that shal come of them.

\10 *The fift reason is the apparent signes of their sex./*/ By this time thou wilt say with me, that the drone is the male-bee: Whereof if some curious chirurgion would make an anotomy, he should easily discerne *duos amplos & candidos testes/*, two sufficient witnesses of his masculine sex.
The light of this truth began to appeare many yeares agoe, even in Aristotles time. *Aliqui/* (saith he) *mares esse fucos, fœminas vero apes esse contendunt./* Which opinion he reciteth in another place. *Sunt qui fucos mares esse, apes fœminas arbitrentur/*. \His l.5.c.21/ Where though he doe not approve it, yet hath he no other reason against it but this. *Arma ad pugnam viresque exercendas nulli famina anatur atribunutur./* Nature hath armed the Bees to chastice the drones, *v./* \*v.n./*20/ and therefore the drones cannot be their males. 
The weaknesse of which reason I marvaile he did not see, seeing in all the kind of hawkes the female doth command the male, as being both stronger and better armed. Whereunto may be added the example of the *Amazons/* raigning in his time: who by force of arms subdued many kingdomes of men, and held them in subjection: like unto which, it is marvaile but there were then some masterful viragoes in Greece, as wel as there be now in other countries. But of this point in the end of the same Chap: hee yeeldeth himselfe to have no certaine knowledge. *Non tamen satis adhue ex-/* [cw:*plorata/*]

*explorata qua eveniant habemus./*

\11 *When the Bees begin to breed/*/ To returne therefore to our purpose, the hony-bees having, as those other *insecta/*, conceived by the drones; the best about *Pisces/* when they first gather upon flowers, others in *Aries,/* and the weaker later, begin to breed their femals thus.
\12 *The manner of their breeding/*/First close under the hony (which is that time altogether in the upper parts of the combs) in the middle of the bottomes of the void cels as the waspes doe on one side, they begin to lay their seedes, about the bignes of those which the butterfly leaves upon the cabage leaves: but of different colour, the Bees being white like wasp seeds, and the butterflies yellow. And so they descend by degrees toward the nether part of the combes filling one cell after an other. Although when the chiefe breeding is past, they doe not precisely observe this order, but lay up their hony among the yong Bees where they find the cells void. \13 *The Bee seed is first turned into a worme./*/ The Bee-seed at the first sticketh upon one ende until it be a live worme or grub: as soone as it liveth it is loose, and lieth in the bottome of the cell round like a ring, one end touching the other, till so the bottome can no longer conteine it: after that, it lieth along in the cel til it be growen to the full bignesse of a Bee: and then doth the worme die and becommeth void of al motion and sense, and so is shut up in the cell, the [cw: Bees] 

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$
Bees covering the top close with wax. 
\14 *The worme being dead groweth to the shape of a Bee and then liveth againe./*/ The worme thus lying dead doth by little and little grow to the shape of a Bee, but of colour white as before: and having obtained the full proportion, then doth it first begin to move againe, and to live hir second life: and thence forth by little & little turneth browne. Before she is perfectly browne, she flieth abroad practising to worke: and all this within the space of a month. 
\Hist.an.l.5.c.22./ *Foetu posito incubant, exclusus inde vermiculus, dum parvus est, iacet in favo obliquus: postea sua apse facultate se erigit, cibumque capit. Foetus apum & fucorum candidus est:ex quo vermiculi fiunt, qui in apes fucosque transeant./*
\15 *The breeding of the lady-bees/*/ But the Lady-bees are bred in the severall palaces of the Queene, *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*9.10/ after a peculiar and more excellent manner. For the golden matter whereof they are made is not turned into a worme at all, but immediately receiveth the shape of a Bee. \Hist.l.5.c.22/ *Primordium regum colore cernitur fulvo, corpulentia mellis crassioris, magnitudine illico proxima suæ futuræ soboli: nec primum ex eo vermiculus gignitur, sed statim apis./* Item. \Colum:l.9.c.11/ *Higinius negat ex vermiculo, ut cæteras apes, fieri ducem; sed in circuitu favorum paulo majora, quam sint plebii seminis, inveniri for amina repleta quasi sorde rubri coloris, ex quæ protinus alatus rex figuratur./*

manner in wider cells made for the nonce *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*8./ they breed the male-bees or drones: as was long since observed, *Sunt fuci sine aculeo velut imperfectæ apes, novissimequam a fessis & jam emeritis inchoatæ, serotinus fœtus./* \7 *When they come abroad/*/ And therefore some stalls doe not drony before *Cancer/*, not many before *Gemini/*, nor any before *Taurus/*; although you may see the +Nymphs of good stals abroad in *Aries/*, of others in *Taurus/*, and of all in *Gemini/*. By chance some few Cephens may be bred betime with the femals: but they, as comming out of season, are not suffered to live. 
+The yong Bees are called schadons: *schadones sobolem dico./* Hist l.5 c.22. The brood of femals, when they have the shape of Bees, are first called Nymphs, and the yong drones Cephens: *Cætera turba cum formam capere cæpis Nymphæ vocantur ut fuci cephenes/* Pl.li.11.c.11.
\18 *Two uses of the drones./*/ These Cephens or drones, when they are fledge, doe not only serve for generation as hath beene shewed, but also doe helpe the femals much, by reason of their great heate, in hatching their broods. *In fœtu adiuvant apes, multum ad calorem conferente turba./* \Pl.l.11.c.11/ \19 *Where they ly/*/ And for these causes they are alwaies in breeding time mingled with them throughout the hive. Although afterward  (when they have beene much beaten, and can goe no where single, but one or other will be on their jacks) they gather altogether in a cluster, for their safty in one side of the hive: so that it is true at some time which the Philosopher spake indefinitely, *Tenent alves locum peniti/* [cw: *orem/*] 


===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$

*orem/*. And yet their hanging together will not serve their turne: for the Bees, when they are disposed, will quickly make them part, and depart. When there is no use of them, there will be no roome for them.
\20 *The male bees are subject to the females./*/ For the drones are but vassales to the hony-bees, which as they doe excell them in virtue and goodnesse, so doe they also in power and authoritie, ruling and over-ruling them at their pleasures. \Nat:hist,1.11.c.11./ *Sunt quasi servitia verarum apus quamobrem imperant ijs./* For albeit generally among al creatures the males, as more worthy, doe master the femals; yet in these the femals have the preeminence: and by the Gramarians leave the feminine gender is more worthy then the masculine, *hæc apes/* then *hic fucus, hæc Nympha/* then *hic Cephen./* But let no nimble tonged Sophisters gather a false conclusion from these true premisses, that they by the example of these may arrogat to themselves the like superioritie: for *Ex particulare non est syllogizare,/* & he that made these to command their males, commanded them to be commanded. But if they would so fain to have it so, let them first imitate their singular virtues, their continuall industry in gathering, their diligent watchfulnes in keeping, their chastitie, cleanlinesse, and discreete œconomie, &c. And then, if they meete with such idle dotrels as these drones are, they may with lesse blame borrow a point of the law [cw: and]

and enjoy their longing. 
Yet this they may note by the way, that albeit the females in this kinde have the soveraignty, yet have the males the lowder voice, as it is in other living things, doves, owsils, thrushes, &c: the males being knowne by their sounding and shril notes from the silent females. Yea the wives themselves wil not suffer that hen to live, which presumeth to crow as the cock doth: nature teaching that silence, and soft noise becommeth that sex. 
\21 *When the bees leave breeding & bear away their drones./*/ The Bees breeding or laying of seeds beginneth to cease, in some by *Leo/*, in some not before *Virgo/*. After which time these +Amazonian Dames, having conceived for the next yeere, begin to send away their mates, & to kill those that afterward force in among them.

\5 *A kinde spring for swarmes./*/ A warme, calme, and showring spring causeth many & rathe swarmes: whereas dry, windy, and cold-stormy wether doth then worke contrary effects. For it both hindereth the breeding, because the old Bees at such times wil go little abroad, and when they do, they find smal state in the flowers; and also destroyeth the breed, because the tender fry adventuring into the ungentle aire, are so beaten & chilled upon a sodaine, that few are able to recover the hive.

\6 *Swarming wether/*/ Likewise in warme and calme weather the swarmes delighte to arise, but specially in a gloome after a showre; in extreme hot and dry wether not so: *v/* \*V.n./*19./ in so much that stals being ful and ready to swarme with the first, are somtime so kept backe with cold dry windes in *Gemini,/* and with extreme heat & drought in *Cancer,/* that they have not swarmed at al that yeere.
\7 *The swarming howres/*/The swarmes use to come forth betweene the howres of nine and three, but chieflie betweene eleven and one. They choose rather the forenoone if the wether please them: other [cw: wise]

wise they will stay for a faire howre in the afternoone. This time of the day therefore in the swarming months your Bees must continually be attended.
\8 *The two swarming monthes./*/ The swarming months are two, *Gemini/* and *Cancer/*: one month before the longest day, and an other after. I have heard of a swarme upon *S. James/* his day, but surely those Bees had forgot themselves. \9 *Rathe swarmes./*/ Those that come in the ascending of the sun betweene *Gemini/* & *Cancer/* are rathe swarmes. \10 *Late swarms/*/ Those that come in the descending betweene *Cancer/* & *Leo/* are late swarmes. But there are fewe that come in the first fortnight, and they very good, few also in the last fortnight, namely after *S. Peters/*-tide, and they very bad. Yet the backwardnesse of the yeere, when it happeneth, may mend them much. 
Those that swarme before the blowing of knap-weed, come in very good time, before the blowing of blackberies they may live and doe wel, but blackbery-swarmes are seldome to be kept, unlesse you meane to feede or drive them. \11 *Black-berie swarmes are seldome to be kept./*/ For they are more likely to die then to live: & if they live, they will not swarme the next yeere. And moreover they weaken the stocks from whence they came, which otherwise would swarme betime the yeere following, and then one such swarme  is worth three of those lateward ones. Wherefore prevent their rising, *v.c./*3.*n/*.32. [cw:An]

\12 *A prime swarme & an afterswarme naturall/*/ An old stal ful, or yeereling welnight ful doth naturally & usually cast twise, a prime-swarme & an after-swarme: although some full stals do not cast once, some but once, and some having many princes (specially when the prime-swarme is broken) doe cast three or fowre times. \13 *A stalle may cast 4. times./*/ For sometime it happeneth that in the going foorth of the swarme a blacke clowde rising stayeth parte of them that are alreadie come foorth, and lie about the hives-dore: \14 *Divers causes of breaking the prime swarm/*/ sometime when they are al uppe either fearing a clowde, or disliking the lighting-place, or being troubled in the hyving, parte doeth returne.
\15 One prime-swarme is worth two or three after-swarmes./ One prime-swarme is worth two or three after swarmes, except it be broken: and then if the residue come foorth in one entire swarme, that after-swarme may bee the better of the twaine: but if it bee divided into two or three, then will they all bee but indifferent, which can hardelie live till the nexte sommer: and therefore must either bee taken or fedde: except you put them to some other. 
\16 *The vulgar Bees appoint the rising of the fore-swarmes, & that upon 4 grounds./*/ The choice of the time when the first colonies, or prime-swarmes thall goe foorth, the rulers referre unto the commons: who by reason of their continuall travell and businesse both without and within, doe best knowe when all thinges are readie and fit for them: [cw: First]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

First within they will bee sure that they have a Prince readie to goe with them, for without a governor they will not bee. Then that their hive bee full, so that it maie bee divided at the least into two or three sufficient companies: one to remaine with *Marthesia/* the olde queene, an other to go forth with *Antiope/* the prince, and a third happylie, which together with the unripe brood in the celles maie make an other swarme to serve *Orythia/*. Without likewise they wil see, first that the flowers be in state presentlie to furnish them with store of wax and honie:then that the wether doe please them, as being warme, and calme, and moist, unlesse, being continuallie unseasonable, they have no choice. 
\17 *Five signes of the first swarming./*/ When the hives begin to be ful, they will dronie, or yeelde foorth fledge drones: which is a signe that the first broode of nymphes have beene a good while flying abroade, and are now able to endure both weather and labour. *v.c./*4.*n./*16.
Other signes of the hives fulnesse and readinesse to swarme are at the hive-dore. First the Bees hovering in colde eveninges and mornings. Secondlie the moistnesse or sweating uppon the stoole. Thirdly their hastye running uppe and downe. Fourthlye their first lying foorth in foggie and sultrie [cw: mor-]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

mornings and evnings & going in againe when the aire is cleere. But this last signe is seldome seene in temperate weather. 
\18 *The signe of present swarming./*/ Sometime, when they swarme, they fly away as fast as they come forth: but for the most part they first gather together without at the dore not only upon the hivel, but upon the stoole also: where when you see them begin to hang one upon another in swarming time *v./* \*v.n./*7/ & to grow into a cluster that covereth the stoole in any place;then be sure they will presently rise, if the weather hold. The first that come forth will increase that cluster to some fourth part of the swarme and then begin they to fly away first out of the hive, and after from the cluster:&c. *v.n./*27.
But here you must note that as to fill the hives dore, or to ly forth a little now and then in foggie or sultrie mornings and evnings (which is because then they are most offended by heate within and can best indure the aire abroad) & otherwise to goe in againe, is a signe that the hive is full, and therefore are like to swarme shortly after; \19 *To ly forth continually is a signe they will not swarme./*/ so to ly forth continually (as in extreame hot and and dry sommers they use to doe) under the stock or behind the hive &c. specially after *Cancer/* is come in, is a meanes to hinder their swarming. For the Bees knowing by nature that the greatest companies doe prosper best; until they find themselves so pes [cw:tred]

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

tred with heate and throng of multitudes that the hive can scarce hold any more, wil have no mind to swarme. And when they have once taken to ly forth, the hive wil alwaies seem empty, as though they wanted company. 
\20 *How to remedy their lying forth/*/ To remedie this, you must in hot weather keep the hives as coole as may be, by watering and shadowing both them & the place where they stand. 
If this cause them not to keepe in; then about eight or nine of the clocke in cleere and calme weather, drive them gently into their hives with your brush *v./* \*v.n./*39/ and ever now and then powring a little water downe the forepart of the hive, keepe the doore coole and moist until either the Bees bee gon in or it be about 10 a clock: afterward let them doe what they list: happily (if the wether like them) they wil come forth and swarme: unlesse they have no prince to goe with them, without whom they never remove. Thus may you try them 5 or 6 daies so it be before Midsommer, and before the honydewes be rife: for is it pitie they should loose their part of them. Therefore if by that time they swarme not, suffer them no longer: but if the stall be a yeareling, reare the hive and let the Bees in: and then wil they enlarge their combs and gather hony which before lay idle abroad, and increase almost to as much profit as if they had swarmed, by the next yeeres [cw: great] 

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

great and timely swarmes. But if the stall be of many yeeres, then turning the bottome of the hive upward set a leere prepared hive fast upon it: into which they wil ascend and worke and breede there as well as in the old. At *Libra/* you may drive *v./* \*v.c./*10.*par./*1.*n./*17./ them all into the new hive, and take the old for your labour. 
\21 *The signes of after swarmes/*/ The signes of the after-swarmes are more certaine. For whereas the rising of the prime-swarme is appointed by the uncertaine vulgar, whose chiefe direction is the fulnes of the hive; the hive being now well emptied, for other swarmes there needeth some other warning, \22 *The rising of the after-swarmes is appointed by the rulers./*/ which the rulers themselves doe give by their voices: without which that stock will swarme no more that yeere. And yet the choice of the hower, yea and of the day among foure or five is permitted unto them, as best knowing the disposition of the weather. 
\23 *When they begin to call or sing./*/ When the prime-swarme is gon (if the stock shal swarme any more) the seaventh or eight evening after, sometime the ninth, tenth, or eleventh, the next prince, when she perceiveth a competent number to be fledge and ready, beginneth the musick in a begging tune; as if she did pray her queen-mother to let them go: whereunto if she yeeld consent by hir answering (as to the petition of hir second daughter she seldom saith nay, though sometime shee consent not in two or three daies) then looke [cw: for]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

for a swarme: which seldome ariseth the next day, unlesse the weather be very pleasant: but after two or three daies they will accept indifferent weather. I have not knowne any stay after the fift day. 
\14 *The Bees musicke./*/ They sing both in triple time: the princess thus 

{Musical notation} 

with more or fewer notes, as she pleaseth. And sometime she taketh a higher key, specially toward their comming forth, and beginning the od minim in *Alami re/* shee tuneth the rest of hir notes in *C sol fa/* thus, 

{Musical notation}

But the Queene in a deeper voice thus;

{Musical notation}

continuing the same, some foure or five semi-briefes, and sounding the end of the every note in *C sol fa ut./* So that when they sing together, sometime they agree in a *perfect third,/* sometime in a *Diapente/*, & (if you respect the termination of the base) sometime in a *Diapasso/*. With these tunes answering one another, and some [cw: pauses] [F]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

pawses betweene they goe solemnly round about the hive, so to give warning unto all the company. \25 *When you may best heare it./*/ This they continue daily untill their swarming but you may heare them best in the evenings and mornings. If there be many of the Queenes breed that are ripe, they will joine withher in hir tune, the more to incite the swarme to goe, that their turne may come the sooner: I have heard three of them together. But none dare counterfeit the voice of the Prince: for that were treason to hir person. And yet sometime one of them, in hope to part the swarme, wil steal out with her: but if the swarm be not parted, or being parted be put together in one hive, it costeth her hir life. *v.c./*1.*n./*7.
\26 *Before the Bees swarme the voices come downe to the stoole./*/ In the morning before the swarme come abroad, these Princes come downe neerer the stoole and there they hold on their melodie somewhat longer, singing sometime above 20 notes togither, and with shorter pauses.
\27 *The manner of their swarming/*/ At the very swarming time they descend to the stoole: where answering one another in more earnest manner, with thicker and shriller notes, the mainie begins to march along, thronging one another for hast, and buzzing with their winges in great jolitie.
As soone as those galant Nymphs are aloft, they doe most nimbly bestirre themselves sporting and playing in and out as if they were dancing the hay, in this manner waiting for the [cw: com-]

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

comming of their Prince. Now when some two third parts or three fourth partes of the swarme is passed, the musick ceaseth, and then commeth forth this stately dame *Orythia/*: who walking two or three turnes before the dore, of purpose you would thinke to be seene, she takes hir leave, leaving but a smale traine to follow hir: which high them after as fast as they can. This decent order the great Lords of the earth seeme to have learned of this little Lady: who in their country progresses, goings to Parliament, and other solemne processions, doe send the greatest and fairest part of their retinew before them, having behinde but a smale troope of necessarie attendants to gard their persons. 

\28 *The prime-swarme being broken, the next may call and swarm within the eighth daie./*/ If the prime-swarme be broken, the second will both call, and swarme sooner: and by that occasion happily a third also may rise, yea and sometime a fourth but all within a fortnight after the prime-swarme. \29 *All the swarmes of one hive come within a fortnight/*/ After the second swarm I have heard a yong Lady-bee call: but the Queene not willing to part with any more of hir company did not answer: and the next day she with seaven more were brought forth dead. *v/* \*v.c./*1.*n./*7./

\30 *What to do when a swarm is up./*/ When a swarme is up, it is a common fashion to make a harsh noise with a pan, kettle, bason, or other like thing, thereby to stay them from flying away. Which indeed is no new thing, as being used in *Aristotle/* his times *Gau-/* [cw: *dere/*]

*dere etiam plausu/* (saith he) *atque sonitu apes videntur. Quapropter tinnitu æris, aut fictilis convocati eas in alveum ajunt./* But for any thing that I have observed, if it doe no hurt, it doth no good: and at the least they loose their labour that use it, you see them begin to fly aloft, which is a token that they would be gon, cast dust among them to make them come down. Not withstanding do what you can sometime they will away, and perhaps fly so far before they settle, that though you follow them never so fast, you must be content to leave them, happily to the happy finder. For when you have lost the sight & hearing of them, you have lost all right and property in them, *Examen ex alveo tuo evolaverit, eo usque intellegitur esse tuum, donec in conspestu quo est, nec difficilis persecutio ejus est: alioquin occupantis est. Justinian. l./* 2. *institutionum juris de re: divis./*

\31 *Some swarmes provide their houses aforehand/*/ Sometime they wil bee provided of a house before they swarme, which some harbingers have found, and viewed, and dressed against their comming: as either a holow tree, or a void hive: and then wil they away presently, and by no meanes settle til they come thither. \32 *and then they flie away directly to the place./*/ Unto which place they wil flie, not, as at other times, uncertainely this way and that way: but as directly as they can guesse. In so much that if a tree stand in their way, they wil nether take the one side nor the other, but passe straighte through him. A poore woman having taken [cw: a poore]

a poore swarme to keepe for halfe by neweyeerestide lost hir owne part and hir partners: and being carelesse of the hive when the Bees were dead, shee let it stand abroad til shee had forgotten it: the next sommer comming into hir garden, shee found some Bees passing to & fro hir hive, which were then busie in clensing and dressing it: she wisely fearing that the Bees came to cary away the wax that was leaft, bad hir daughter take the hive and carry it in: the wench following hir play did happyly forget hir mothers command: & by that meanes the hive stood stil, til the unexpected swarm came, that afterward stored hir garden. It is not amisse therfore to follow the councel of *Columella./* \33 *Vacua alvearia stet semper parata in apiario./*/ *Oportet autem vacua domicilia collocata in apiariis habere. Nam sunt nonnulla examina, quæ cum processerint, [+statim sedem sibi quærant] in proximo, eandenqe occupent quam vacuam repererint/*.
+Seu potius prius quæsitam, lustratam, & paratam ad eant. *v.n./*31.
\34 *The hiving of Bees./*/ When your swarme hath made choise of a lighting place, you shal quickly see it knit togither in forme (if nothing let) of a pomegranat, or cluster of grapes. Assoone as the better part is settled, or at least assone after as may be, hive them. \35 *When they are to be hived./*/ For the longer they hange the lother they are to be put from the place, the more time they loose from their worke, & the more in danger are they to bee gone. For when they are once [cw: setled] [F3]

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

setled, they presently send forth spies, to search out an abiding place: who if they returne with good news before swarming-time be past that day, they rise presently, & are gone: otherwise they will stay till swarming time the next daie. \36 *The token of their flying away after they bee setled./*/ But whensoever the spies have sped, they returne with al speed, & no sooner do they touch the pomgranate, but they begin to shake their wings like as the Bees doe that are chilled: which the next perceiving do the like: and so doth this soft shivering passe as a watch-worde from one to an other, untill it come to the inmost Bees wherby is caused a great hollownes in the pomgranat. When you see them do thus, then may you bid them farewel: for presentlie they begin to unknit, and to be gone. And then though you hive them never so wel, they wil not abide. 
\37 *How to fit the hives to the swarmes/*/ When you see your swarme, first make choice of a hive for it. If you would have it to cast the next yeere, you must take a hive proportionable to the bignes & time of the swarme. A swarme of the beginning of *Gemini/* put into a hive that conteineth thrise so much as the swarme is: A swarme from the beginning of *Cancer/* into a hive that conteineth twise so much: And others as they come later, so let the hives bee lesse in like proportion unto these: So that the Bees may fill their hive thay yeere, or at the least within a handful or a little more, which they may [cw: make]

===

$*and the hiving of them/*/$

make up the next yeere in good time. For they wil seldom swarme before the hive be full. For example: a swarme of a peck at the beginning of *Gemini/* should have a hive of three pecks: & such a one at the beginning of *Cancer/* shoulde have a hive of halfe a bushel. 
\38 *How to make your stalls great/*/ But if you desire to have great & faire stals, because little ones are not wel able to defend themselves against their enimies, namely weather, waspes, and robbers; then let your hives be of a bushel or thereabout, if the swarmes may at the least halfe fil them the first yeere: for then wil they thoroughly fil them the next, and perhaps swarme: & the third yeere if it be kind they wil not faile. But then are they to be kept warme the first winter, *v./* \*v.c./*3 *n./* 38./  Otherwise you maie put two good swarmes togither, *v./* \*v.n./*52./ and then they wil be able to keepe themselves warme. 
\39 *A Mantle a Rest and a Brush alwaies in a readines./*/ Your hive being fitted & dressed, you must have also in readines a Mantle, a Rest, and a brush. The Mantle may be a sheet or half-sheet, or some other linnen cloth an ell square at the least. The rest is a three-square sticke eighteen inches long, & three inches thicke. The Brush is a handful of benets, hysop, or other herbs, or boughs bound taper-wise togither. 
\40 *What the hives must doe./*/ Al things necessary thus prepared, let the hiver, which must weare no offensive apparel, *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*25./ first drinke of the best beere, and wet his hand and face therewith: and then let him go about [cw: his] [F4]

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

his busines soberly & gently taking good heed where he sets his foot & how he handleth them for if hee treade upon a Bee, or by any other meanes crush one of them; they presently finding it, by the ranke smel of the poisonous humor, wil be so angry; that he shal have work enough to defend him selfe, unlesse he have on his complet harnis, *v/* \*v.c./*1.*.n/*38./ and being thus disquieted they will be the worse to hive. 
\41 *The manner of hiving./*/ The manner of hiving is so manifold, by reason of the many and different circumstances of the lighting places, that it can hardly be taught by precepts; but is rather to be learned by use and experience, guided with reason and discretion. Neverthelesse for the helpe of novices, I wil set downe some particular instances, which may serve for discretion in al other. 
\42 *How to hive a swarme that lighteth upon a bough./*/ When your swarme lighteth upon a bough, if it bee within two foote of the ground, first spread your Mantle right under it, and laie the Rest upon the Mantle about a foot from the midle, toward that side which is from the winde, if the winde be rough: otherwise set it towarde the sun: for there must be their way in and out the hive. Then cut the bough (if you may conveniently) & lay it on the mantle along by the Rest, & set the hive over it, so that on side may stay upon the Rest and hang out over it some 3. inches. If there be any other boughes with bees besides, lay them upon the mantle by the [cw: hive] 

=== 

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

hive, which if you wag now and then a little they will make the more speed into the hive. Otherwise you may shake downe the Bees upon the mantle: and let the hive over them as before, and they wil presently up into the hive. Otherwise you may shake them into the hive, & set the hive upon the Mantle and Rest as before. And if any begin to knit againe upon the bough, cease not to shake it, or else, when they are knit, cut the bough, and lay it by the hive.
And if some of them bee fallen to the grounde, then placing the Rest as neere unto them as may be, set the hive over them as before without a mantle, and the rest of them having cut the bough or boughes lay beside the hive. 
\43 *How if it light upon a high bough./*/ If the bough be higher, cut it of likewise: and if some of the swarme chance to fal in the cutting, then hold the bough in the place, till they be settled againe, and so bring them downe in your hand or for more suretie let an other second you with the ready hive holding it directly under the swarme: them having first taken away al the twigs of the bough that may let you, cut of the bough or boughs (for sometime  they will hang upon two or three) & put them into the hive: & so bringing them down set the hive upon the Mantle and Rest, as before. But if the tree be very high, and you want a lader or other meanes to come down gent- [cw:ly]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

ly with them in your hand; you may let them downe by a corde. Then shake them from the bough upon the Mantle, or into the hive, and do as before. 
\44 *How if it light upon a bough that cannot be cut./*/ If you cannot conveniently cut the bough, your next way is to shake the Bees into the hive, and, presently, covering the bottom with a cloth, so bring them downe: and then taking away the cloth set the hive upon the Mantle as before. But then you must looke that many will rise againe, and not easily forsake the place. For which cause you must not cease to trouble them by shaking the bough, wiping them of gently with your Brush, and laying on mugwort, marges, nettles, or other weedes, or hearbes, and by spitting and blowing upon the place: and after a while they will all to their fellows in the hive. 
\45 *How if it light upon the body of a tree./*/ If they light upon the body of a tree, or upon some great arme that will not be shaken, then set one side of the hive right over the Bees, & with the Brush drive them up by troubling still the lower and waiward part. But if you have no meanes to fasten the hive by tying it above, or propping it beneath with prongs or the like, then must you be faine to sweepe them into the hive with the Brush (not in any wise with a goose wing *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*23./as some use to doe) and then setting them on the Mantle and Rest under the tree trouble the place as before [cw: If] 

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

\46 *How if it light upon the top of any thing./*/ If they light on the top of any thing, as of a stub, pollard, or hedge; set one side of the hive over them propping the other side with a prong or two, and drive them up as before. 
\47 *How if it light in the middle of a dead hedge./*/ If they light in the middle of a dead hedg (unlesse you can, by removing some sticks, conveniently come at them to drive them in) you must violently knock the hedge on the other side, so forcing the Bees into the hive: and then setting them downe, trouble the place as before. But then be sure to be troubled your selfe: for it is hard to get them from such a hold. 
\48 *How if it light on some hollow side of a stub (shrub??) or tree/*/ If they light on some hollow side of a stub or tree, which they wil be loth to leave, beware in any case you wet them not, for that doth not only drowne many, but also maketh the rest more eagerly keep the place: because some through the wet cannot fly away, and their fellowes finding them there will still resort unto them. But when you have moved them by other meanes as much as you may, put some morter or cloome into the hollow place, moving it forward by little and little so that you burie none of the Bees, until you have spread it over the place: and then they will presently forsake that, and take some other part of the tree or stub, where you may more easily hive them. 
\49 *How if it flyinto a hollow tree/*/ When they fly into a hollow tree, so that by none of the foresaid meanes you can hive them, then must you remove them by some offen- [cw: sive]

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

sive smoake, and make them chuse a new lighting place: which is thus to be done. If the Bees ly above the hoale they went in (as they will doe if they may) then boare a hoale above them: if beneath, beneath them: but be sure that the upper hole be wide enough, rather then fail make two or three with a two inch auger. Then file a piece of match, or for want of match, take a little hay, or other thing that will smoke moderately, and not flame; and put it into the tree beneath them: and you shall see them fly forth above for life, & presently settle in some place where you may hive them. But this is to bee done the same or the next day at the farthest: for afterward they will abide the smother, and rather loose their lives then leave their goods. 
\50 *The swarme is alwaies to be kept together lest the Bees kill one another./*/ But in all manner hivings this one rule is generall. The swarme must be continually kept together: for if at that time part remaine from the company but the space of half an houre or lesse, afterward when they find them, and would returne unto them, they are used as strangers and robbers: for as fast as they come they are beaten and killed: and those that escaping thence goe back to their old home, find no better entertainment: and those few that escape thence, desperately runne into any other hives, and so leape out of the frying pan into the fire [cw: And]

=== 

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

And therefore when the swarme is hived, if you see part begin to gather together by themselves, remove them as speedily as you can, that they may goe to their fellowes in time. 
\51. *The swarme to be set neer the lighting place./*/And alwaies set the hive as neere the lighting place as maybe: which if some inconvenience wil not suffer you to doe, yet set it within the length of a pearch, or at the least within sight & hearing: and then lest those which are least at the lighting place, by loosing their company a while, loose their lives also; first trouble them by the meanes mentioned. *n./*43. & then cause some of the hived parte to arise by shaking them of the bough, and by wiping them downe that are on the outside of the hive. Which, when they are up, will make such a noise, that their fellows may easily finde them. And if anie yet hankering behinde chance to be set upon when they come to the hive, be-sprinkle the mantle, the hive, & the Bees with a little strong drink, and you shal part the fray. 
And if any man marvaile why they of the same swarme shoulde so soone be strange one to another, seeing that Bees of one hive being pent a whole day in an other, are yet welcome to their fellowes at the last; I can give no other reason but this, that they knowing a swarme may part, & so each part become a several com- [cw:pa-]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

pany, they deeme these to be such by their long absence. And if you aske why they shoulde finde so hard entertainment in their old home from whence they came, it is because they went away with a governour of their owne, and so became a several company. And therefore if she bide away, as many as come backe (unlesse they come presently) are used as strangers: but if part have brought hir home againe, the rest do safely returne afterward, either that evening, or the next morrow.
\52 *What to doe if a swarme part./*/ If the swarm part, as somtime it wil, & settle in divers places so neer that thet may see each other; let the greatest part alone, specially if it be best to hive, & trouble the other in the setling with shaking, gentle rubbing with weeds, and spitting & blowing in the place, that they may go to their fellowes. If they be setled & hand upon a bough, cut the bough and bring them to them. If they be settled in some other place, then put them in a hive without spleetes: and if they bee within a pearch of the other parte, move them both, one towardes an other by little and little they be close togither. After they have stoode so about halfe an howre, lift up the spleeted hive from his Mantle & Rest, and shake the bees out of the unspleeted hive upon the same: you may first knocke the hive downe right upon the mantle, & then presently clap it twise or thrise betweene your hands. [cw: This]

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

This done sprinkle both parts with good drink, and then without any stay set the spleeted hive over them and they wil straight way up into it. But lay the unspleeted hive along hard by, not where it stood, but on the other side: and those that remaine in it wil follow their fellows. But if the parts be farther a part then a pearch, then drive them togither the same night, *v.c./*10.*p./*1.*n/*17.beginning at *late in an evening/*, *&c./* unto *and forthwith carrie/*, & when by clapping of the stranger you have gotten as many Bees forth as you can, first pul out the little combe that they have made, putting it into the receiver: & then use the hive as the unspleeted hive.
\53 *When & how to put two swarmes togither./*/ In like manner when you have little swarms about a gawne or under, specially after *Cancer/*, put two or three of them togither, whether they rise in the same day, or in divers: (but then make that the reciever which was first hived.) For being thus united they wil labour cheerefully, gather store of wealth, and stoutly defend themselves against al enimies, whereas if they were kept a sunder, they would surely perish the next robbing-time, or winter, or hiving would doe you little good. And thus may you do to those that are good, if you desire to have them excellent good, *v/*, \*v.n./*38./ and therefore if two swarmes rising at the same time do weld & knit togither, (as lightly they wil doe, if they be within hearing one of another) never trouble your selfe [cw: to]

to part them, nor to be sorry for the chance. For those two being all one, are better then three such that are alone. Wherefore they are little acquainted with the nature of Bees that fetch their similitudes from them to crosse that rich, mighty, renowmed, thrice happy *Union./* In joining two swarmes togither use them as if they were two parts of one: And if they rise in divers daies, drive the later into the former. 
\54 *How to stay a swarme that is going home again./*/ When a swarme upon some dislike goeth home againe, if you perceive it before many be entred the hive, shut the dore: so will they settle upon the hive, where you may easilie hive them. For the swarmes that returne into the hive do sometime stay long before they rise againe, & when they rise, specially if they were hived, they are likewise to fly away: although I have knowne a swarme to rise fowre times in three daies, and at the last to be quietly hived. 
\55 *How to keep them from other hives when they ar going home/*/ If anie of them bee going into an other hive (as somtime, where the hives stand neere togither they wil do, because they cannot discerne their home for their fellowes that are so thicke before the dore) shut that hive, or stand before it: for as many as enter will die, or scape narrowly.
\56 *What to doe when the swarme is new-hived/*/ When your Bees are hived, those that hang on the outside drive in gentlie with your brush: and lay the corners of the Mantle, that are farthest from the Rest, over the hive, with boughs [cw: also]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

also to shadow it, if the weather be hot. But if you find them unwilling to goe in (as in extreame hot weather they wilbe, though they like the hive wel enough) then strive not with them, but laying the corners of the Mantle over the hive, as before, with boughs to shade it, there suffer them til the heat be abated, and then drive them in: and if you thinke they cannot otherwise wel endure the heate, cover the hive againe with Mantle and boughs. And so let it stand til it wax dark, and all the Bees be come home. 
\57 *How to remove it in the evening./*/ Then knitting the foure corners of the Mantle together, at the top of the hive, and binding the Mantle about close to the middle of the hive with a smale line, cary the swarme to his place. \58 *How to set it on his seat./*/ And after a while, taking away the Mantle, set it upon his seate with the dore toward the South or rather Southwest: *v./* \*V.c./*2.*n/*.15./ and leaving only a breathing place, for feare of stifling them if the hive be close, then cloome it up close, and put on a hacle *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*13.*&/*19./ and so let it stand til it bee faire and warme the next day. For if the hive be least open, in the morning betimes they wil resort to their former standing and there abide, sometime flying about, somtime settling on the ground: where if the cold or wet take them many dy. \59 *How to use it in the morning/*/ When you see the weather fit them, then hanging the Mantle, or other whit cloth upon the hive, let them go: & at night take away your Mantle [cw: againe.] [G]

againe. 
\60 *A swarme lighting neer his seat is presently to be set thereon/*/ If the swarme light in your garden within a perch of the seate that is appointed for him, it is best to set it there at the first. So will not the Bees loose any time the next day in haunting an other place, as knowing their home: and therefore need no white cloath over them for their direction, nor to be shut in the morning as other swarmes. 
All swarmes, if the morrow be faire, will desire to be abroad betimes, and knowing their want, wil bestirre themselves more lustily in their labour then other Bees. 
\61 *Foul wether the first day doth much discourage a swarme./*/ But if the fowle weather keepe them in the first day, then are they much discouraged: the next day being indifferent, when other Bees worke hard, they will scarce looke out of the dore, not daring to commit their leene & thin bodies to the cold aire. And if they be shut in the second day also, then will they not wagge (though they dy for it) untill the weather bee very pleasant. \62 *A swarme may live 5 daies without hony./*/ They may live five daies in the hive without hony: but afterward they begin to string downe hanging at one anothers heels. *Pedibus connexæ ad limina pendent./* Which is a certaine signe of death, if they be not presently relieved with hony and faire weather.

\1 *Bees most industrious creatures./*/
{U}Nto the industrious nature of Bees nothing is more odious then sloth and idleness: while there is matter to worke upon, unles they be let by unkinde weather, their labour never ceaseth: yea the old Bees, which have spent their daies in continual labour, wil not at the last alow themselves any immunity or rest in their hives, as a recompence for their paines past, but continue stil their travaile unto death, *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*54./
\2 *In three months they cannot work/*/ In the three dead months indeed, *Sagit. Capric./* & *Aquar./* because then there is nothing to gather, they worke not, (yet when a faire daie or howre commeth they fly abroad to play & recreat themselves: *v/*) \*v.c./*1 *n/*55/ but so long as any good flowers grow, even from *Pisces/*, or a litle before unto *Sagit./* \3. *All the yeere after they loose no time/*/ and some yeeres somewhat after, which is full nine months, they loose no time. *Nullus, dum per cælum licuit, perit dies./* \Nat: hist, l.11 c.6./ But follow their sweet work tooth and naile.

\4 *How they gather wax./*/ Their work consisteth in making either wax or hony. The wax they gather with their fangs: which being kept soft with the heate of their little bodies, of the aire, and of their hives is easily wrought into combs. This work is so nimbly and closely done, that it can hardly be perceived: insomuch that *Aristotle/* plainly confesseth. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Nec vero quemadmodum operantur visum ad huc est/* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.16/ But *Plinie/* willing to goe a little beyond him telleth us a tale of a lanthorne hive made at Rome, through which forsooth their doings in the hive were discried, & in another place of another like devise. \Nat.hist.lib.31.c.14/ *Multi alvearia speculari lapide fecere, ut operantes intus spectarent./* But unlesse the Bees also were transparent as well as the hive, this cannot be: seeing they do alwaies frequently compasse the combes round about. A more likely way then that were to have a moveable piece in one side of the hive, which when you have taken away, you may see the drones and the hony-bees walking together to and fro, and with their doubled heat hatching their yong, but their worke can you not see: [cw: though]

===

$*and labour./*/$

though you remove and part the Bees til the bare combes appeare. \5 *How you may see the working of the combs./*/ But if your curiositie would so faine behold the maner of their curious & artificiall building, the only way is this. In *Gemini/* set up a last yeeres midling swarme two or three handfulls above the stoole: & then when most of the Bees are abroad, but most fitly in the forenoone when they are most quiet, you may behind the stole behold them working on the edges of their combes, and having blowne their liquid and soft wax out of their mouths (as the waspes doe their drossie stuffe, which you may see them gather from pales with their fanges and so carrie it away) to fasten and fashion it with their fanges and forefeet.
\6.*How much they bring at once/*/ How much wax they bring at once, doth appeare by the new swarmes whose first weekes worke is spent chiefly in building combes: wherein they are so earnest, that it falleth out with them as it is in the proverbe, *The more hast the work speede./* For many of their burdens do fall from them before they can fasten them to the combes. You may then see great store of them upon the stoole by the skirts of the hive, like unto the white scales which fal from yong birds feathers. And therefore some have imagined, that they also are scales, which the yong Bees doe likewise shed from their wings. But put you some of those parcells together with warme fingers, and you will quickly be resol- [cw: ved] [G3]

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

ved of that doubt. 
\7 *The fashion of their combs and celles./*/ The Bees combes are placed otherwise then the waspes: for the waspes hang theirs one over another, and the Bees their one by an other. Beginning them in the top of the hive, at that distance that a Bee may reach from one to another. 
Their cells or little hoals are made six square according to the number of their feet: and of that length and widenesse, that each of them may easily conteine a Bee. Which are so artificially wrought and joined together, that S. *Ambrose/* in the consideration thereof saith. \Hexamer.l.5.c.21./ *Qua castra quadrata tantum, possunt habere artis & gratiæ, quantum habent crates favorum, in quibus minutæ ac rotundæ cellulæ connexione sui invincem ful ciuntur? Quis enim architectus eas docuit hexagoniailla cellarum indiscreta laterum æqualitate componere, ac tenues inter domorum septa ceras suspendere, stipare mella, intexta floribus horrea nectare quodam distendere?/*
The use of these cells is to lay up their hony in, and to breed their Nymphs. 
\8 *The drone-combe./*/ Besides these ordinary combes there is commonly one drone-comb in a hive, wherein the Cephens are bred, made for the nonce with wider celles. \His.l.9.c.40/ *Sunt loculi ipsi sucorum ampliores, & finguntur seor sim quoq, per se favi fucorii./* Although in some hives the neather parts of the drone-combes be made out with Nymph-celles. The [cw: drone] 

===

$*and labour./*/$

drone-combe being no thicker then others, & yet the drones longer then the smale Bees, they increase the length of his cels by covering them not with a flat cover, as they do the rest, but with a deepe holloe one like an old wives thrumbed cap: which afterward, when the drons are bred, they take away. And when those cels are void of Cephens, they fill them as they doe the other with hony; yea and after swarming-time, if they want upper celles for their hony, they wil not tarry til they come forth themselves, but liking better their roome then their company, they draw them out of their seminaries before they be ripe. 
\9 *The queenes cels are built single in divers places./*/ But the queenes celles are built single, every one by himselfe, and that in divers places of the hive, some above, and some beneath: that, as other princes, shee may for hir delight remove at hir pleasure: but for the most part in the outsides of the combes: for although it be fit for princes to be neere their chiefe cities, yet doe they not love to bee pestered in the midst of them. \10 *In fashion a round/*/ In fashion they are round, which is the most perfect figure, as the six square is most fit for comely joining many such buildings together. They are also larger then the rest, to shew that subjects houses should not match their soveraignes in greatnesse. In these pallaces doe they breed their yong princes, *v./* \*v.c./*4.*n./*15/ \Nat.hist.l.II.c.II./ *Plinie/* speaketh thus of them. *Regias imperatoribus extruunt/* [cw: *amplas./*] [G4]

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

*amplas, magnificas, separatas, tuberculo eminentes./*
\11 *The common error anent these celles./*/ The common people finding them alwaies in those stalls that die, take them for certain signs of death, and cal them pipes forsooth, or taps: and therefore when they see them in a stal that they take, they say this was taken in good time for it is piped, and therefore would have stood no longer. But seeing none are without, no not the yongest swarmes, ordinary reason might teach them to forgo that fond conceipt.
\12 *The combes have 3 colours successively./*/ The combs at the first are white, which they cal Virgin-wax: after the first summer they turne yelow: and in the end, when they wax old and begin to corrupt, they change againe to a blackish & durty colour. \13 *Wax is gathered only in 4 months./*/ The time when they gather wax is only betweene *Taurus/* and *Virgo/*: unlesse *Aries/* bee warme and kinde, for then they may begin in that month. 
\14 *Hony in 9/*/ But hony they gather al the yeere, save only in those 3 dead months, when the weather keepeth in both Bees and flowers. \15 *The Bees gather 2 sorts of hony./*/ And it is of two sortes: the one pure and liquid which is called *Nectar/*, the other grosse and solid, which we may like by reason tearme *Ambrosia./* For both serve for the foode of these divine creatures. 
\16 *How ambrosia or grosse hony is gathered./*/ The grosse hony is gathered by their fanges: from whence is it conveied by the fore legs to the thighes of the hin-legs (*Quæ flores comportant prioribus pedibus fœmina onerant propter id natura scabra, pedes priores rostro:toteq onustærement far/* [cw: *cina/*]

===

$*and labour./*/$

*cina pandatæ/*) and so nimbly, that unlesse you have a quicke eie, you can scarce perceive it. 
This worke may best be seene in the spring, when they gather upon the blackthorne: for then by reason of the cold they are not so quicke.
\17 *Ambrosia some serveth to feed the scadons: some is wrought with nectar and laid up in store./*/ In sommer, when they have brought these burdens home, some unload them into the dry cells for their yong to feed on, which are not yet able to fly abroad: others worke them with the *Nectar/*, which being of it selfe cleere and thin, is thereby made thicke and yelow. And in the beginning & ending of the yeere, look what they save when the wether is faire, they lay up for themselves against a rainy day. Which while it is good they wil feed on, to save their old store as much as may bee. \18 *Ambrosia alone is soone corrupted./*/ But this kind of hony is like unto fresh fish: it must not long be kept. For if, being laide up in the cels, by reason of plenty that comes in fresh and fresh it ly unspent: after a while it corrupteth, and of sweet becommeth the sowrest and the most unsavory of al things both to the tast and smell, which then they commonly cal stopping. \20 *Much stopping maketh the Bees forsake their hives./*/ Where there is any store of this stuffe, it doth so offende the Bees, that oft times it maketh them to forsake all. Most of them wil that yeere goe foorth in swarmes: and those few that are least wil never prosper, *v./* \*v.c./*3.*n./*43./
Anent this leg-stuffe or grosse hony there is [cw: a]

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

\21 *This ambrosia is commonly taken for wax./*/ a general error. For without al scruple or doubt men do count it & cal it wax (as did some also in time of olde, whose opinion *Aristotle/* doth thus deliver. \His.l.9.40./ *Ceram apes perreptando flores capiunt priorum acumine piæum: mox priores in medios abstergunt, & medios in blæsa posteriorum./*) But against (as I shal shew you) both sense and reason. 
\22. *Which error is disproved by sense./*/ If you put it to your tongue, it hath the taste of hony, which wax hath not. If you feele it betweene your warme fingers, it muttereth apart, where wax sticketh fast togither. If you put it to the fire, it melteth not, as waxe doth. And whereas wax is al of one colour, that is white at the first, *v./* \*v.n./*12./ even as those little fallings of the new swarmes, (which is wax indeede) this leg-honie is of divers colours, white, black, yelow, green, red, tawny, oringe, murry, and of sundry midling colours. Therefore sense doth say it is no waxe. 
\23 *And reason./*/ The reasons are two. The first is because when they gather abundance of this stuffe, they have never the more wax. The other because when they make most waxe, they gather none of this. 
For proofe of the first, All Bees betweene *Virgo/* and *Taurus/* do gather abundance of it: & yet are not in their combes in this time any whit enlarged. Also one of those old stals that are ful of combes, doth carrie more of this matter al the sommer long then many swarmes & yet [cw: have]

===

$*and labour./*/$

have they no more wax at the end of the yeere then at the beginning.
For proofe of the other, The new swarmes within one weeke, if the wether serve them, wil have halfe filled their hives with combs: & yet in al this space shal you scearce see one carry anie of this. If you would knowe the reason why the stockes gather so much, & the new swrmes so little; it is because the stockes have *schadons/* which they feed with part, & the new swarmes have none: but the more part the stockes doe mingle and worke with *Nectar/*: whereas the swarmes at first do lay up pure *Nectar/* onlie, *v./* \*v.n./*26/ And if anie foolish Bee do carry in *Ambrosia,/* it is put a dry cell where it turneth to stopping, *v./* \*v.n./*19.24 *And by authoritie/*/ as I have seene within a fortnight after the hiving. 
And this though now it seeme new, yet was it knowne many ages agoe. *Plinie/* writeth of it thus. \Nat.hist.l.II.c.7./ *Præter hæc/* (I.*præter ceram & nectar/*) *convehitur erithace, quam aliqui sandaracham, alii cerint hum vocant. Hic erit apum dum operantur cibus: qui sæpe invenitur in favorum inanitatibus sepositus; & ipse amari saporis./* Speaking in the last words of that which is corrupted. And before him *Aristot./* himselfe thus. \His.l.9.c.40/ *Mell apibus tum estate tum hyeme cibo est: sed recondunt alterum quoq cibarii genus, cui durities ceræ proxima quod sandaracham non nulli appellant./*

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

\25 *How the pure nectar is gathered./*/ with their tongues, whence they let it downe into their bottels, which are within them like unto bladers: each of them wil hold a drop at once. You may see their little bellies strut with all. Men thinke because they see nothing on their legs, that they come in leere: when they are better and more heavily laden then the other. These bottles, assone as they come home they emptie into their combes. \Hist.an.li.c.22/ *Mel ore evomant in cellas./* \26 *At the first the Bees lay up meere nectars: afterward they mix it with ambrosia./*/ The swarmes beginning at the tops of the hives do lay up cleere *Nectar/* onlie, that it may last many yeeres if they can spare it: afterward they worke *Ambrosia/* and *Nectar/* together. And this is the cause why the hony is the upper part of the combes differeth from the rest which is alwaies yelow and soft; wheras that is cleere as crystal at the first, and liquid as water: and when it is two or three yeeres old becommeth white and hard. *Concresit autem mel concoctum iam tempore : initio enim ut aqua dilutum est, & primis diebus sine crassitudine cervitur./* \Hist.an.l.5.c.22/
\27 *Nectar of two sorts./*/
So that the *Nectar/* or liquid hony is of two sorts: one hard and white even like unto sugar, which is therfore called stone-hony, or corne-hony: the other so soft that it will runne, which therfore is called live-hony. \28 *Live-hony of two sortes/*/ And the live-hony is likewise of 2. sorts that which is cleere & crystalline gathered of a swarme, and taken the just yeere they cal virgin-hony, \*Virgin-hony/*/ which it is there- [cw:fore]

fore the purer because the cels are pure: the other which is yelow & thicker as being mixed with *Ambrosia/* (and therefore in the clarifying yeeldeth more skum) is called second honie. \*Second hony./*/ The virgin hony by standing turneth yelow: but it wil be a bright and pure yelow, whereas the other is darke and duskie: except in plentiful yeeres of *Nectar/*: for then the first shoot, *v./* if it be wel handled, wilbe litle inferiour to Virgin-hony. \*V.c./*10.p.2.*n./*2./
\29 *The full cels they close with waxe./*/ When the cels are full, they close them up with little filmes of wzxe, which they wil not breake untill winter and hunger drive them to it. And thus do they al the sommer, descending lower and lower from one cel to an other, until *Virgo/*: after which time they lay up no more in store. \30 *After Leo they lay up no hony/*/ For hony then waxeth scarce abroad, & thence-forth they can gather no more wax to shut it in. As for that which they purchase by fight & foraging, it doth them litle good. For the most part of it they presently spend & if they save any, they halfe fil a few cels with it, which being uncovered, ether themselves or some other theeves quickely devour, according to the proverbe, *Evill gotten goods are scone spent/*.

in great abundance: as apple, crab barbery, beech crowpickes, charlocke, rosemary, &c. But speciallie the plentifull Vetch, and Maple. They gather on the flower of the maple a whole month together, and somewhat on the flower of the vetch when his time is *v./* \*v.n./* 37./ but the greatest store of hony is drawn out of the black spot of the litle picked leafe of the vetch, which groweth on each side the two or three upper-most joints.

I would rather judge it to be the very quintessence of all the sweetnesse of the earth (which at that time is most plentiful) drawne up, as other dewes, in vapours into the third region of the aire by the exceeding and continuall heate of the sun: and there concret and condensated by the nightly cold into this most sweete and soveraigne *nectar:/* and then doth it descend unto the earth in a dew or smale drizling raine: that he might wel say, *Constat materiam, ex qua melgignitur, rori esse congenerem./* \Gal. de aliment. l.3/ Which opinion is the more probable, because that when the yeere us backward in his fruites, the honi-dewes are also backward, comming only at such time as the fruits have the most solid and best juyce. Before, when the juyce is weake and watrish, and afterwarde, when it is dried and wasted, they are not. And this is the reason that in more hot & southernly climats, where the fruites are more forward, the hony-dews are more timely: as in *Italy/* before \Nat hist lib II.c.12/ *Gemini, Non omnino/*, saith *Plinie, priis vergiliarum exortu/*: *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n/*22/ whereas with us they fal not usually before *Cancer/*.
\41 *When the honydews are most frequent/*/ The hoter and drier the sommer is, the greater and more frequent are the hony-dews: & as they are caused through heat, so are they at the last dissolved by cold: but much raine at any time, as comming from a higher region wa- [cw:sheth] [H]

sheth away that which is already elevated: so that there can be no more untill an other fit of hot and dry weather. 
\42 *The time when they fall./*/ The time in which these hony-dewes fall is usually betweene the first and last daies of this month: although the continuance of hote & dry weather may cause them come som what rather, or last somwhat longer, even until mid. *Leo/* or after. They may happen at any time of the day: but for the most part in the morning before it be light, *Sub lucanis temporibus, Itaq tu prima aurora folia arborum melle roscida inventiuntur./*\Nat.hist.li.II.c.12./ And then shall you have the Bees up in a morning assone as they can see, making such a shril noise where they go, that a man may here them father then he can see them.

the rich spotted leafe of the same, before they have beene at home. Although when they come to a flowre that yeeldeth both *Nectar/* & *Ambrosia/*, they wil use somtime the tongue, & somtime the fanges, and gather them both. 
\48 *They gather hony out of poison./*/ But this may seeme more strange and wonderful, that out of the most stinking and poysonful weeds, as redweed, marges, henbane, & the like, they gather most sweet and holesome hony: and yet regard not the best and sweetest hearbs and flowers, as the rose, the prim-rose, clove-giliflowers, lavender, &c. wheat, barlie, pease, and such like.
\49 *What store of hony a stal may have./*/ What store of wax and hony a stall may gather, is uncertaine, some having more, some lesse, according to the number of the Bees, the greatnes of the hive, & the plentifulnes of the yeeres. With us it is counted a good stall that yeeldeth two or three gawnes of poulse: although in a tree there have beene found more then 7. or 8. But in other northerne countries we read of farre greater quantities. \Nat.hist. li.II.c.14/ *Plinie/* affirmeth that there was seene in *Germany/* a hony-comb 8. foot long. And *Paulus Jovius/* that in *Moscovia/* there are found in the woods & wildernesses great lakes of hony, which the Bees have forsaken, in the holow truncks of marvelous huge trees. \De legatione Moscovitarum, & Munsterus de Moscovia./ In so much that hony & waxe are the most certaine commidities of that country.

this story reported by *Demetrius/* a *Moscovite/* ambassador sent to Rome. A neighbour of mine (saith he) searching in the woods for hony slipt downe into a great holow tree, and there sunk into a lake of hony up to the brest: where when he had stucke fast two daies calling and crying out in vaine for helpe, because no bodie in the meane while came nigh that solitary place: at length when he was out of all hope of life, hee was strangly delivered by the meanes of a great beare: which comming thither about the same businesse that he did, and smelling the hony stirred with his striving, clambered up to the top of the tree, & thence began to let himselfe downe backward into it. The man bethinking himselfe, and knowing the worst was but death, which in that place he was sure of, beclipt the beare fast with both his hands about the loines, and whithall made an outcry as lowd as he could. The beare being thus sodainely affrighted, what with the handling, & what with the noise, made up again withal speed possible: the man held, & the bear pulled, until with main force he had drawne *Dun out of the mire/*: & then, being let go, away he trots *more afeard then hurt,/* leaving the smeared swaine in a joyful feare. 
\50 *Bees have necessary use of water/*/ The Bees earnest and hot labour, and the drought of the aire, togither with their cholerike complexion, which their very colour bewraieth, doth cause them much to desire cold [cw: water]

$*and labour./*/$

water. \51 *Chiefly for their breed/*/ Some thinke it serveth chiefly to feede their schadons. *Aquam tum portant, cum prolem nutriunt/*: \Hist. an.l.9.c.40./ and that not without reason, seeing that *Ambrosia/* their daily food is hot and drie: and indeed when the drones are done away, and breeding is ended, the Bees are nothing so frequent at the watring-places. But *Columella/* thinketh the use thereof to be more general, \De re rust. l.9.c.5./ *sine qua neq, favi, neq, mella, nec pulli deniq figurari queunt./*
\52 *The making of the watering place/*./ The watring-place should+ not be far from your garden, in the next side of a ponde or brooke made shelving not steepe in maner of a foord, and defended from beasts, geese, ducks, and such like. 
\Virg.Geor/ 
\53 *How to find wild Bees./*/ +For they wil never go far for water, if any be to be had neere hand *Sub mænibus urbis aquantur./* And therefore when you see Bees watring in woods, or other places not neere any hives, be sure those are wilde Bees, which are not farre from their neast. Watch them therefore which way they flie for they wil thence directly to it. Which if it be not within view, take a reede or kex, or some like holow thing open at one end, with a chinke cut in the other to let in light: and taking up a Bee by the wings put her into the cane, & shut her in with your thumbe: while shee goeth downe to the light, put in an other, and so as many as you thinke good. And then where you last see the Bees flying homward from the water, go to that place, and there let out one of the Bees in the box: which, when shee hath cast a ring to know where shee is, wil fly as directly home as the other: likewise where you see her last, let out an other and so the rest, until they have brought you to the stalle.

Left the Bees flying over the water unto it be throwne downe by tempestuous windes, & so drowned: for which cause it is good to lay lugs overthurt the water & other stales, that recovering them they may drie themselves againe, and so escape. 
\Virg. Geor./ *In medium seu stabis iners, seu profuet humor,
Transversas salices & grandia coniice saxa.
Pontibus ut crebris possint consistere, & alas
Pandere ad æstiniuum solem, si forte morantes

That they may safely settle upon it, and that it maie alwaies be kept moist by the neerenes of the water. For they choose rather to draw their drink out of moist earth then from the water it selfe, though it never be so clear: peradventure that the earth having received his earthynes, which before was insensibly mixte with the water, their triple searching tongue might the better trie out the pure element of water. 
Which otherwise wilbe the death of manhy for they are so earnest in their businesse, that though you offer to tread upon them, they will not move. 
\54 *The fashion of a watring trough/*/ For want of such a watring-place make a shelving trough, and set it in your garden the space of a pearch or two from the stals. And having filled it with water, lay a piece of a thinne bord or lath in the middle of it upon the water, to save them from drowning, if any happen to fal in. When the trough is old & the sides earthy they like it best. 
Of a planke or other piece of timber 3. foot long, 13. inches broad, and 3. inches thicke you may make a double trough with a partition. The length of the concavities let be two foote, the breadth of each 4 inches, the depth at the par- [tition]

tition 2. inches, from whence each bottom must ascend shelving by little and litle unto the outsides. So that there may be least uncut at each end six inches, at each side 2. inches, and in the middle for the partition one. 
If you have no such certaine watring-place, they must spend more time in seeking farther: & in rainy wether they wil ly about the neer plashes & puddles in the streets, where they are ofttimes trod under feet of men and beasts. 
\55 *After a showre they water at home/*/ After a showre they water for the most part in your garden upon the bare earth, the grasse, and wheresoever they finde it wet from above. In the chiefe breeding months *Aries/* and *Taurus,/* when the colde raine or winde hath kept them in some part of the day, they wil lie soe thick upon the grounde, if you have any store, that you can scarce tread beside them. At such time therefore let no heedles stranger come among them.

##CHAP.7/##
\1 *The Bees enimies are many./*/
{T}He good Bee, as other good things, hath many enimies, from which she needeth your help to defend her: namely, 1.the mouse, 2.the woodpecker, 3.the titmouse, 4.the swalow, 5.the hornet, 6.the waspe, 7.the moth, 8.the snaile, 9.the emet 10.the spider, 11.the toade, 12.the frogge, 13.the Bee, and 14.the weather.
\2. *The mouse/*/ The mouse, whether he be of the field or of the house, is a dangerous enimy. For if he get into a hive he makes havocke of the hony, and so starves the Bees. Some enter by the dore, or by some open place in the skirtes of the hive: some gnaw a hoale through in the toppe of the hive, where they know the hony lieth. Some keepe their old homes, and come to the hive only for their baits: some make their neasts betweene the hacle and the hive, that they maie the sooner and the safer come to the hony at their pleasure. 
\3 *How to know when a mouse is in the hive./*/ When a mouse is in the hive, if it be in the day-time, you may know by the Bees: for they [cw: will]

===

$*Of the Bees enimies./*/$
wil sodainly flie forth, as when they swarme, & that so eagerly and angerly, that you may easily know they doe not play, as sometime they use to do, *v./* \*V.c./* I.n.57./ when they are wel pleased: neither wil they cease flying about, until he be gone. But for the most part they steale in the night, when the Bees will not stirre. 
\4. *Remedies against the mouse./*/ For remedy, first you must looke that your hives, whether they be of straw or wicker, be close and fast wrought. For if the strawe bee loose and soft, they will more easily gnawe their way through: & if the wicker be thinne, when they have torne down the cloome, they wil creepe in betweene the twigges. Next see that the hives bee dawbed close round about the skirtes, that there bee no entring but by the dore: which in the end of *Taurus,/* when the Bees come downe to watch, and thenceforth all the sommer, they wil keep wel enough both day and night: but in the winter, at which time the mise make most spoile, it must bee made so narrow, that they cannot get in. *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./* 24 *&/* 26./ Also it behooveth you to remoove all thinges about your hives, that may hide and harbor them: for they will feare to come and goe in fight, lest the cat meete with them by the waie. Moreover it is good now and then, in drie and warme daies to take of the hacles, as well to meete with the mise, as to ayre the moist hives, and to kill [cw: mothes,]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$
mothes, and spiders, and the like. Those mise that neastle upon the top of the hive, when the hacle is taken of, will sit amazed so long, that you may be sure to crush them against the hive with your hand. 5 Lastly you shal doe wel to set baited traps in their waie, that so they may come short. 
\2.*The wood-pecker/*/ The wood-pecker or yippingale, if hee find any hoale in the hive against the hony, doth with his long round tongue draw it out: but hee doth more harme to wood-bees then garden-bees.
\3. *The Tit-mouse./*/ Of Tit-mise there are three sorts. The great Titmouse is a very harmful bird. For although sometime he seem contented with dead Bees, yet is he a great devourer of the quick also. In winter he taketh them at the hive, as they come forth: and in very cold weather when they are loath to stir, he wil stand at the dore, & there never leave knocking til one come to see who is there: and then sodainely catching her away he flies with her: and when he hath eaten her, he comes againe for more: eight or nine will scarce serve his turn at once. But in the spring when the Bees come to the palme, he standeth there watching for them, and while they are busie at their worke he devoureth many. The little russet one in winter feedeth onely on dead Bees; but in the spring hee wil take part with the great one. The little greene Titmouse [cw: I]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

I cannot accuse. 
The swallow taketh them as they fly, *populatur hir undo,/* & alibi *ea demum sola avium non nisi in volatu pascitur/*: \Nat hist.l.II.c.18/ \Nat hist. l.10.c.24./ But I am perswaded she doth much lesse harme then the Titmouse, although she have a worse name. \7 *The swallow/*/ These birds therefore are not to be suffered.
*Absint meropesq aliæq volucres 
Et manibus Progne pectus signata cruentis./*
\8. *Remedy against the titmouse and swallow./*/  Let boies destroie their neasts in sommer, & kill the old ons in winter with traps and pitfals baited with oats or tallow. *Aristotle/* joineth the waspe, the little titmouse, the swallow, and the great titmouse together. \His.l.9.c.40/ *Inferunt injuriam apibus maxime vespæ, & aviculæ quas paros vocant, atq etiam hirundo, & merops qui apiaster est. Quamobrem apiarii vesparum latibula & hirundinum ac meropum nidos propinquos alveis tollunt./*
\9 *The hornet/*/ The hornet also devoureth Bees, being so much to stong for them, that they can make no resistance; which the Poet meant where he said *aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis./* Hir manner is to fly about before the hive, til she have spied hir pray settled at the dore, and then sodainely she taketh it in hir feet, and flieth away with it as a kite with a chicke. 
\10 *The hornets sting is dangerous./*/ In destroying the hornets you must be wary: for one stinging doth ofttimes cause an ague and lesse then thirtie, as some say, will kill a man. \Nat.hist.l.II.c.21./ *Ictus crabronum baud temere sine febri est./* [cw: *Au/*]
 
===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

*Auctores sunt ter novenis interfici hominem./*
\11 *The waspe/*/ The waspe doth much more hurt then the hornet: for the hornet now and then killeth a Bee, but the waspe wasteth the hony, whereby many whole stalles doe perish. For besides the harme that shee doth hir selfe, shee doth ofttimes set the robber on worke, who, when the waspe hath begun, will be ready to take part with her, add then all goes to wrach. A waspe is by nature harder and stronger then a Bee, specially in *Libra/*: insomuch that ofttimes shee breaketh from two or three of them, though they have all hold of her at once: and perhaps killeth one of them out of hand. \12 *The wasp at first feedeth upon dead Bees./*/ About *Cancer/* shee beginneth to bee bred: *v./* \*v.c./*4.*n./*8./ about *Leo/* and the spring being hot and dry somewhat rather, shee first appeareth: and in a while she beginneth to feed upon dead & weake Bees, which she quickly cutting of in the middle with hir fanges, first carrieth away the nearer part, and anon fetcheth the rest, when she hath bitten of the winges for easier carriage not far from the place where she took it up. \13 *At Virgo she stealeth hony/*/ About *Virgo/* she waxeth bold, and adventureth into the hives for hony: but by reason of the strangenesse of hir voice and habit, she is discried before she come neere: and at the first (while the weather is warme, & the Bees both early and late keepe watch and ward at the [cw: hive-]

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$
hive-dore) comming single against many she is commonly beaten back: and if by chance she slip in, she doth not alwaies escape, sometime she is slaine in the hive & brought forth dead; and sometimes she is killed without dores, when she hath got hir pray. But afterward, the weather waxing cold, and specially in mornings & evenings, and the Bees therefore retiring from the dore higher into the hive, the waspes make great spoile among them. And this they continue until *Scorpio/*: after which time they begin to ware. \14 *How long the waspes last/*/ Nevertheles while they live, that is until *Sagit/*, if abundance of cold and wet rid them not a little rather, they wil be filching: & one waspe will carrie out as much as two Bees bring in. In a wet sommer (because they breed for the most part in the ground) much raine rotteth their combes, and chilleth their yong, and so spilleth the increase of them, that your Bees shall not be much troubled with them that yeere. \15 *In what yeer the wasps are most rife./*/ But the sommer being dry they grow very rife and if many dry sommers come together, there wil be such multitudes of them in every place, that, without continual and diligent attendance, you shal be sure of great losse among your Bees by them.
\16 *Remedies against the waspes./*/ Wherefore if you love your Bees, suffer not a wasps neasts about you. The readiest way to rid them is, if they be in the ground, to scalde them; if in a tree or other place, where they build [cw: above]

above the hoale, so that you cannot scald them, then smother them with brimstone, as you kil Bees. And to destroy those that are acquainted with your hives, set by them sider, vertjoice, sowre drinke, meth, or hony-water in a viol open, or other glasse covered with a paper that hath a hoale in the middle: & so you shall take many: and if the meth or honi-water doe now and then drowne a Bee with them, pitty them not, for they are theeves. \Hist.li.9.c.40./ *Aristotle/* teacheth you an other way. *Impugnatur/* (saith hee) *apes a vespis: quamobrem apiarii eas venantur constituta olla, & carne in ca posita. Ubi enim multæ ad carnem accesserint, apposito operculo super ignem ollam ponunt./* You may also use other meanes to kil them your selfe. How to helpe and defend your Bees against them, see *c./*3.*n./*36,36,38,&39.
\17 *The moth./*/ The flying moth lyeth betweene the hacle and the hive, and breedeth little wormes, or crawling mothes, some in the skirts of the hive, some within upon the stoole, and some without upon the hive, specially in the crackes of the dawbed hives. *Plinie/* speaketh thus of them \Nat.hist.li.II.c.19./ *Papileo etiam ignavus luminibus accensis advolitas pestifer, nec uno modo: nam & ipse ceras depascit, & relinquit excrementa quibus teredines gignuntur./* 
\8. *The snaile/*/ They offend the Bees also with their mealines, as the snailes do with their slimines. Wherfore rid your hives of these guests, and specially of the snailes: which wil not long abide, if there be no [har-] 

===

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

harbor of long grasse, weeds, or other thing about the hives. 
\19 *The emet./*/ If emets breed neere your Bees, they will much trouble them, biting them, and hanging upon them: although the Bees if they be lustie, wil kil many of them that come to the hive. But if it bee a poore stale, they wil in time posesse the hive and eate up the hony. The best remedy against them is to scald them. 
\20 *The spider./*/ The spider, as the moth, doth use to harbour betweene the hacle and the hive, where commonly she hath a Bee or twaine in store to feed on, an unfit messe for such a mouth: Sometime she hangeth hir nets under the stoole, which easily intangle a wearie Bee, when she commeth laden home, and missing of the lighting-place falleth into them: yea & sometime where the Bees are few, chiefly in the winter, they wil be bold to enter the hive, & there weave their cruell webbes, *In foribus laxos suspendit aranea casses/*, and then are they very dangerous. \Virg.Nat hist. l.11.c.19./ *Aranei quoq vel maxime hostiles: cum prævalvere ut intexant, enecant alveos./*
\21 *The toad./*/ The toad is by nature so noisom to the Bees that while he is about the hive, though hee ly but under the stoole, the Bees will not prosper. \22. *The frog/*/ He is said also to devoure them at the hive, as the frogge at the watring-place. \Hist an.l.9.c.40/ *Rana apes, ubi ad aquam accesserint, rapiunt: quamobrem eas apis arii per paludes & stagna unde apes aquantur vena-/* [cw: *ri/*]

\Ibidem./ *ri solent. Rubeta etiam apes interimit: subiens enim aditus alves afflat, & observans rapit evolantes. Nullo hæc affic: malo ab apibus potest, sed ab apiario facile interimitur./* Item *insidiantur aquantibus ranæ: quæ maxima earum est operatio, tum cum sobolem faciunt v./* \*V.c.6.n./*51./ *Nec hæ tantum quæ stagna rivosq obsident, verum et rubeta veniunt ultro, adrepentesq foribus per eas sufflant: ad hoc provolant, confestimque abripiuntur./*

\23 *The Bee the Bees greatest enimie./*/ But not any one of these, nor al these togither doe halfe so much harme to the Bees, as the Bees. *Apes api, as homo homini, lupus/*. They make the greatest spoile both of Bees & hony. For as they of the same hive live in inviolable peace one with an other: so have they no entercourse, no friendship or society with others, but are rather at perpetual defiance, & deadlie feud with them. In fight they are fierce, and in victory mercilesse within the space of a day, or twaine, yea of 3. or. 4. howres sometime, if the hive be open that they may have easie passage to and fro, they wil have rid him cleane. And therefore all Bees of all their enimies most do feare strange Bees, knowing well in what danger they are to bee robbed by them both of goods and life. \24 *Robbing or fighting of Bees in winter & sommer but litle./*/ This robbing is practised all the yeere. In winter, as oft as the weather is faire & warme, some wil be prowling abroad And some are so theevishly disposed, that all the sommer long, when abundance of hony is every where [cw: to]

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

to be had for a little labour, they will yet be filching though they dy for it. \25 *In the spring more earnest./*/ At the spring, specially in *Aries,/* they are more earnest, and therfore you must then have an eie unto them. Those stalles that have lost their Queene, or doe dislike their standing for coldnesse, moistnes, mustines, bleetness, or unsavourinesse, as taking no pleasure in their lives, doe easily suffer themselves to be robbed in the spring. And if none wil come to rob them, then on some faire daie they wil away together, sometime leaving both hony and yong ones behind them. \16 *The most spoil is made in Virgo./*/ But in *Virgo/* is the most dangerous time of all. Then shall all the stalles in your garden bee tried, whether they be such as will yeeld or no. And *Libra/* would not be much better, but that the most spoil is done before. \27 *What stals are most subject to robbing/*/ Little & poor swarms are much subject to robbing: likwise those Bees that are offended with the blacknesse and rottennesse of their combes, caused through age or wet, or with abundance of noisome stopping: wil most of them goe forth in the swarmes, leaving a very few, sometime not past a handful in the stocke: which yet in robbing-time wil keep the dore, as though the hive were full: but the robbers finding their weaknes wil surely spoile them, if they be not prevented. How to knowe such Bees, & what to do to them, see *c./*3.*n./*43. 
\28 *The robbers are the lustiest stalles./*/ The robbers are thought to be poore swarms and stockes, which have not sufficiently provi- [cw:ded][I]

\Nat.hist.l.II.c.17/ ded themselves for winter: of which opinion was *Plini/* where he said. *Quod si defecerit aliciuis alvei cibus, impetum in proximas faciunt rapinæ proposito/*. but indeed such are fitter to be robbed, as before is said, then to be robbers. There is no thiefe to the rich thiefe: who although he have enough and more then enough, yet by hooke or by crooke he will have more, though the poore starve for it. 
\29 *How they begin the fray/*/ At the beginning of *Virgo/* the fat and full stalles doe send forth some of their stoutest yo?kers to spie and give the onset which going about from hive to hive so far as their walke extendeth, doe prove al. Where they have once sped, at their returne they bring more of the their company, until in the end that whole stall bee made acquainted with it. Sometime it happenneth that though there be an hundred stalles within a walke, yet the robbery is done altogether by one, sometime by two or three, al the rest being quiet. \30 *Theeves of divers hives agree together in robbing/*/ And this one thing is strange, that whereas no Bees wil abide strangers in their hives with them, yet theeves wil suffer on another & agree altogether in stealing, though they be of divers hives.

In their fight they are so furious sometime, and so thick about the garden, that unles you have your complet harnes, *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*38/ you may not dare to come nigh them.
\36 *The exercise of the the defendants when the enimy receiveth/*/ This also I have noted, that when the robbers are so few, that smal resistance wil serve, yet being called forth they wil not be idle: for you shall see some of them running up and downe about the hive, to seeke and search if any more come: others like trained souldiers, pracrising to fight, here one wrestling with another in single combat, there 2 or 3 or 4 setting against one, as their usual maner is to deal with the theevs. If you would knowe whether this fight bee in jest or earnest, with fellowes or with foes, the maner and the end thereof will shew you. For if they be fellows, their fight is not so fierce, & they wil part quietly as friends: whereas if they bee foes, though they scape, it shall bee with much adoe. For if the true men cannot kill the theeves, yet wil they hold them by the legges [cw: or]

\40 *When the true Bees yeeld, they go with the conquerors/*/ vermacht with multitude, see there is no remedie, and that no resistance wil serve; at length they yeeld, and suffer the conquerours quietlie to spoile their goods. And after a while, when, by being togither in the same hive and sucking the same hony, al smel slike; they wil joine with their enimies, and help cary away their owne goods, and so become friends & live togither. At night they lodge with them: but in the daytime they returne with their newe fellowes to fetch that is leaft behinde. And when they have done, it is marvaile but, being encouraged by this victory, they set upon some other stall neer adjoining: and so is your whole garden in danger.

If you perceive their fighting in time before my great harme be done, then this must you do. First stop them up close that none can passe ether in or out, leaving only a breathing place. Then shal you have a double conflict, one within, an other without. The theeves that are with in, having no way to escape with their prayes, first or last wil be slaine al. They that are without, after a little wrestling, seeing nothing to be had but blows, wil not long abide this bootles danger. When you perceive the siege to be raised, and that there is litle or no fighting without (which wil be about an howre after) then may you let out your Bees, making the dore half an inch high, & scarce half an inch wide. Those fewe that were within will they bring forth to burial, some then, some on the morrow. In the evening, when the Bees are al In, shut them up as before. The next day betimes, before the Bees would bee abroad, must you looke for some of them againe. When they are come, beat them away with a bough, but kil them not: for so may you do your neighbour a shrewd turne, and your selfe too. 
But let not the Bees out before noone: and then make the dore so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once. So will the Bees keepe the [cw: robbers] [I4]

robbers out, and followe their busines neverthelesse. The nexte day you may let them out rather: and if the dore be so narrow that it hinder their passage, you may make it wider. If this do not suffice, but stil the strange Bees wil strive to get in; assure your selfe that stall hath but a few Bees, and is not in case to be kept. And therefore if you be loth to take it now, because of the schadons that may corrupt the honie, then you must looke unto him carefully; least by little and little it come to little or nothing. 
\44 *When it is too late, and what is then to be done./*/ But if the Bees have yeelded before you are aware of it, so that the theeves rob quietly with out resistance; or the stall be much spoiled and the hony-cels broken (which you may perceive by the crumbs of waxe upon the stoole) then having shut the hive close assone as you can, the next evening or morning take that is leaft: otherwise in the end you shal loose all. For the Bees thereabout smelling the hony when the combs are broken, wil have it or die for it. 
This fierce and cruell robbing being alwaies in harvest, when people are busie in the fields, many hives are least honylesse, and they never the wiser. Wherefore it is good to leave some body at home, as well to watch these as the two legged robbers.

\46 *Bees kill poore swarms that wander in the spring/*/ Besides those Bees that are thuis spoyled in robbing, many also are killed by other stalles when they come to them for succour. For in the spring those swarmes that were lateward, or have beene halfe robbed, when they have spent al their store, the next warme day after away they fly: some to a tree where they hang til they deade, some adventure into other hives, where if they have large entrance, that they may throng in sodainly, sometime they scape with the death of some few, and being mingled togither continue with them as one stal: but for the most part they die every each one, *v/*. \*V./*c.I.*n/*20./

\50 *In winter the sun shine in frost & snow/*/ At winter, the sun shining in frosty or snowie weather is dangerous to the Bees. For the sun tilleth them abroad, and the frost chilleth them: many as they fly, that they canot returne: and many that returne, while they rest on the ground before the hive: but the snow amazeth them, & causeth them presently to fall & rise no more. 
\51 *Also the easterne winds and great frosts/*/ Also the freezing Easterne windes, & all great frosts kil many in the hives that be open, or uncovered: and therefore at such times it is good to shut them up close, *v./*  \*v.c./*3.*n./*53./ and to see them well hacled, *v.c./*3.*n./*16.
\52 *And the cold continued maketh them sicke./*/ And if the cold continuing keep them long in, it maketh them so sicke, heavy, and chillie; that many die assone as they come abroad into the aire, unlesse it be very pleasant, *v.c./*3.*n./*53.
\53 *The raine rotteth the hives./*/ Also the raine doth ofttimes soake into the hives and so corrupteth the combs and killeth the Bees: specially where the company is smal, not having heat enough to drie them againe.

\55. *the greatest losse by weather is in the spring for then infinit multitudes are beaten downe laden and wearie with storms and winde./*/ But the greatest losse is in the spring. For the Bees, specially the yong frie, being laded and wearie with their labour, some at their worke, some in the way home, some at the hive-dore are beaten downe, not only through soddaine stormes, but also through cold rough windes: and then unlesse the sun shine, or the wind ly, they never come home againe: in so much that sometime you may see the lanes *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n/*47.56/ strewed with them.
\56 *At the rising of a clowd they post home/*/ And therefore, when being a field they see a stormie or rainy clowd arising, presently they high them home for life: tumbling to the hive as thick as haile, thrunging, & throwing down one another before the dore for hast. Where if the cold raine catch them before they can recover the hive, they are in no better case then those that the storme beat down by the way: although when they are fresh and light, they wil fly abroad in the midst of a warm shower, not caring for it.
\57 *Yet wil they goe afield in the midst of a warme shower./*/ They which are thus taken abroad must take their chance: but if you defend your Bee-garden as you ought, *v./* \*v.c./*2.*n./*2.4&5./ you shall prevent the fall of many at home.

revive with the warmth of your hand, so that it will seeme a miracle unto you. For presently (their spirit returning) you shal see them begin to pant and breath againe, and anone they will fly away as lustie as the best.

##CHAP. 8/## 

\*Remove Bees in a faire day/*/ {R}Emove your Bees alwaies in a faire day, and as neer as you can gesse in setled weather. For when they are moved to another place, if it be within their circuit or walke, they will fly to their old standing as soon as they are let goe, and hanker about it sometime six or seaven daies: where if the cold wet catch them, many loose their lives. And if you remove them out of their knowledge, then, as amazed in an uncouth place, they fly about for a while viewing the country, and searching for their old home: when they are weary, they rest wheresoever: and if foule weather come upon them, they are in like danger. 
\2. *Not in sommer/*/ It is not good to remove Bees in sommer for letting their Work in the chiefest hony-gathering. 
\3. *Nor in winter/*/ And it is worse in winter, for loosing the Bees. For if fowle weather fall not, the very stil cold wil kil many, while they are straying abroad: and of those that returne, being not yet [cw: ac-]

$*Of the removing of Bees/*/$
acquainted with the hive-dore, some will fal short, some upon the hive: where, while they rest panting, the cold chilleth them. 
\4 *The fittest time in the autumne & spring./*/ The fittest time is either in *Libra/* & the fore-part of *Scorpio/*, that they may thoroughly know their new standing before the weather be too cold; or in *Aries/* & the later part of *Pisces,/* that they may bee acquainted with it before any great gathering of hony. 
Neverthelesse if you have Bees in other mens keeping, whose care and skil you mistrust, you were better to remove them in sommer before *Virgo/* for feare of robbing; or in winter for feare of mise & other evils, then to hazard al by their ignorance and negligence.
\5 *Libra the best month in all the yeare./*/ But if you may choose, remove in *Libra/* only, which is simply the best.
\6*The time of the day and manner of removing./*/ In the evening, when you meane to remove an howre before sunset prop up the hive from the stoole with three bolsters two or three inches thicke, that the Bees may ascend from the stoole: about halfe an howre after, having prepared an other stoole of the same highth & of sufficient breadth, and having covered it with your mantle so that the middle of the mantle be over the middle of the stoole; move the stall with his stoole, if you may, a little aside, and set this covered stoole in his place: or if it cannot wel be moved, then set the covered stoole close to the old stoole either beside it, or before it [cw: this]

===

$*Of the removing of Bees./*/$

This done, lift up the stal from his old stoole & set it upon the new: and then wiping the Bees from the old stoole (if any remaine) with your brush, ether take the stoole away, or cover it with a cloath: and then if your new stoole be only a planke without legs borne up by some other meanes, it is good to set it upon the old. Within a while when the Bees are all in, knit the mantle at the fowre corners over the top of the hive so as the knots may not slip, and presently binde it to the hive about the middle slackly with a smal line, and wrest it fast with a little sticke. And so is the stall ready to be removed.
\7 *The usuall manner of removing/*/ They use commonly to make no more ado, but after sunset when the Bees are at rest to lift up the stal and set it upon a mantle spreade on the ground, and so to binde them up, leaving the Bees upon the stoole (which in a good stall are not a few) behinde them. \8 *Whic is fit for poore stalles./*/ Which way, for such stals as have al their Bees up in the hive, may serve wel enough.
\9. *How a good stall is to be carried./*/ The best way to carry your stal is upon a cowl-staffe betweene two, and rather with the top downward then upward. If it be light, one may carry it in his hand. But howsoever, be sure it hang perpendicularly for feare of breaking the combs, specially if you chance to remove before *Libra/*, \10 *How a bad/*/ when the waxe is soft and the lower partes of the combs are heavy with [cw: yong]

##*Of the feeding of Bees./*/##
##CHAP. 9/##

\*What Bees are to be fed/*/ {B}Lackberrie-swarmes, which by reason of their latwardnesse have not gathered provision enough to bring about the yeere, with third & fourth swarmes, if anie be, which are smale and weake, and others also which through your negligence the robbers have least in the same case, must have some help at your hands if you mean to keep them. As for stockes that have not gotten sufficient stockes, or being once gotten, have lost them againe; there is no hope that they will thrive, & therefore take no paines about them.
\2 *When they cease to lay up in store./*/ At *Virgo/* the Bees cease to lay up hony: yet all that month they wast not their store, unles they be robbed, but live of their daily labour from hand to mouth. In *Libra/* likewise they spend little or nothing.
\3 *When and how long they spend on the stock./*/ But in *Scorpio/* & *Pisces/* their gathering is little in the three months betweene them nothing at all. In *Aries/* & *Taurus/* the plants yeeld then more plentie of food of both sorts: but then [cw: they] [K]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$
\Wet, cold, and windy/ they have more companie to spend it, and unkind weather oftentimes suffereth them not to goe forth for it. So that all this while they live upon the stocke: yea the weaker stals somewhat longer, as being not so wel able to abide the cold aire. And therefore for want of wome store to feed on between whiles at home, I have knowne some die after mid-*gemini/*
\4 *Some are stored for a longer time, some for a lesse./*/ Of which seaven months some have provision only for six, some but for foure or five: and some also not for so long a time: which you may well joine with the unthriftie stockes. *v./* \*v.n./*1/ for they are not worth the feeding. 
\5 *The usual time of feeding./*/ When men perceive by the lightnesse of the hives that they wax leene and honiles, they begin to feed, some about *Pisces/*, some sooner, some later, giving to each one everie morning, before other Bees are abroad, a spoonful of hony: and so they continue until *Gemini/*, if the weather be then warme; otherwise somewhat longer, without intermission. For the Bees will duly looke for it, and languish if they lacke it. 
\6 *The usual maner of feeding/*/ Some give it them in a spoone: but that way many of them besmeare their wings, & if their fellowes licke them not cleane presently before the cold chill them, they die. Others, to avoid this inconvenience, give it to them in a tost, which being warme drinketh in the hony, whence they draw it out with their tonges: but this waie wasteth hony, and doth not al- [cw: to-]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

together avoid the former inconvenience. Others have other devises: but indeed the only good waie is to give it them in a piec of acomb *v./* \*v.n./*19./ If you use to knock the hive, when you put in the hony; they wil come down as duly as sheep to a cal, when they are to be fodered. 
\7 *This late feeding often fayleth/*/ This feeding of Bees is altogether condemned by some as paineful and fruitlesse, saying if you feed them not, they can but die: and soe wil they doe when you have bestowed your labour and cost. \8 *Yes it may save such as have some store./*/ Indeed many of them, that are thus fed, do, miscarrie: but if the hony be good, and duely given them before their store be al spent, for the most part they live: the sommer following they provide sufficiently for winters, & the next they are likely to swarme and grow fat.
\9 *How to save those that have no store in the spring/*/ But if any of your stalled, at any time in the spring, be so neere driven that they have spent all (which you may know by their lightnesse and lothnesse to come abroad, when others are busie) then because feeding in such a case doth seldome say, if you will save their lives, drive them into a stall that is fat, and they wil agree and cast the soone: the manner of driving see  *c./*10.*part./*1.*n./*20. 
\10 *How to feed Bees without hony./*/ For want of hony many other things have been used insteed thereof. *Aristotle/* mentioneth figges, and all such sweet things. *Apiarii ficus ac reliqua ad genus dulcia cibum apponnut./* \Hist.li.9.c.40/ and *Plin/* speaking more particularly commen- [cw: deth] [K3]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

deth raisings, and figges, and teased wool wet with meth, or honi-water, or sweete wine made of raisings, or new wine boiled. \Nat hist. l. 21. c. 14./ *Si cibus deesse censeatur apibus, vuas passas siccasue, sicosque, tusas ad fores earum posuisse conveniet: item lanas tractas madentes passo aut defrunto, aut aqua mulsa./* And some of our country-men have practised to give them bay salt, and beane flower, and sweet wort. Al which things though they will be spend, yet cannot the Bees be preseved by then without hony. 

Touching the councell of *Plinie./* this is to bee noted, that if you place their food *ad fores/* before the dore, it wil draw strange Bees unto them: whereby the hives of the one, and the goods of the other wilbe endangered: if you place it abroad from your hive, then wil it bee common: and if within upon the stooke, which is best, then must you remove it in time, *v.n./*16 otherside it will be no better for them if it were set *ad fores/*. And as for the devise of teased wool, it is a fitter meanes to catch Bees then to seede them: for if the liquor bee above the wool, it will lime the winges of many; if not, many wilbe entangled in the smale haires as birds in a grinne. Cover it therefore with a linnen cloath so that the Bees may not creepe betweene. 

\11 *The best time of feeding./*/ But it is far better to feed the Bees before they need (that they may save their store which they have shut up in their celles until the spring) namely in *Scorpio,/* when otherwise they would [cw: begin] 

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

begin to spend on the stock. And not before, lest it be taken from them; nor yet when it is colder then they can endure, lest in seeking to save their lives you cause their deaths, either within as they are feeding, or without when they are gon for water, which at such time they can not want. 
\12 *The benefit of rathe feeding/*/ Halfe the hony that they spend in the spring, as they are commonly fed, wil serve them at this time, and doe them twise so much goof. For those that have spent their own store, and have litle or nothing leaft at the end of winter, ar so discouraged & so feeble with fasting, that knowing their thin bodies can beare out no cold, they wil not come abroad but when they are fed, and then only to fetch water, unles the weather be exceeding warm & calme: & the more they keepe in, the weaker still they are. But those whose rather feeding hath caused them to spare their store till the spring, will bee as cheerefull as the best: in any reasonable weather they wil abroad, and fetch in that fruitfull *Ambrosia,/* which causeth them presently to breed. *v.c./*4.*n./*11.
\13 *Bees are to be fed according to their want./*/ The poore swarmes are to be fed much of little, longer or lesse while, according to their want. What each swarme wanteth cannot certainely be knowne: neverthelesse, through some direction together with experience, you [cw:may] [K3]

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

may guesse neere the matter, alwaies observing this rule, that it is safer to offend in the excesse, then in the defect: although what wanteth at this time, may be supplied in *Pisces/* following. *v.n./*17
\14 *What propotion of hony to the Bees in requisit/*/ Halfe the same quantity of hony that is of Bees wil keepe them al the winter. And therefore a gawne of hony wil serve a pecke of Bees without feeding. And a pottle will serve so many from *Pisces/* forward. So that such a stal having but a pottel, needeth an other pottel to be given them in *Scorpio,/* to feed them til *Pisces./* And so proportionably of the rest. You may also conjecture, when you have fed them, whether they have sufficient, by comparing them in weight with other swarmes that are well provided. 
\15 *The best manner of feeding./*/ The best way to feed Bees is this. First take an emptie combe, and powre thereon so much hony as it may receive: if you thinke it be not liquid enough, then either warme it first in a pot over the fire, or else spread it all over the combe with your knife, that it may sinke into the cels: for which purpose live-hony is the best. \16 *The fittest time of the day for it is the evening./*/ The honies combe place upon a treene platter, or holow round bord almost of the compasse of the hive within: & then in a faire calme evening when the heate of the day and of the Bees worke is past, put it upon the stoole, & so set downe the hive over it. Then wil those Bees [cw: to] 

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

to worke a fresh, being out of danger of other Bees which then begin to rest their wearyed limbs. And in the morning they wil at it again betimes with al possible speed, that they may have made cleane worke before the heat of the day: by which time the bordering Bees, being rife abroad, wilbe ready to rifle them if they once resent the hony. And therefore to that time, whether the comb be rid or no, take it away, and close up the hive. The next evening (if the weather sit) dresse it so againe, not ceasing until you have given them so much as will suffice. This hony, when they have first taken their refection, they convey into their voide cels: which because they cannot nowe shut up (as before *Virgo/*) for want of waxe, *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*13/ they do but halfe-fil. And therfore they first spend of it, reserving that which was more safely laide up until the last. 
If insteed of this combe thus dressed you wil take a ful honi-combe, then first open the cels with your knife: otherwise they wil not convey it, but wil cover and keepe it as their own combs til the weather wax cold, & then they forsake it and suffer it to spil. 
\17 *The second feeding time/*/ At *Pisces,/* if you feare they will lacke, (which you may perceive by their lightnes) doe like-wise, and supply their want: but then it is best to give them their food in a morning, leaste colde and darknes overtake them, whiles greedy hun [cw:ger] [K4]

===

$*Of the feeding of Bees./*/$

ger maks them stay to long: & so to let it stand until they have conveied it. For in that month there is no great feare of robbing. 
\18 *The third time of feeding if need be./*/ And if having omitted to feed them sufficiently at these due times, you thinke it necessary to give them somewhat in *Aries/* or after, when the wether is warme againe, let it be done in the evening as before in *Scorpio./*
\19 *A general caveat./*/ But alwaies bee sure, assone as the combe is laid, that the hive be made close, with no greater entrance then must needs be: lest the borderers smelling the booty breake in, not without danger to the stal, and death to manie of themselves.

But if they have cast twice that sommer (unlesse they were very forwarde & had to beat away their drones by *S. James/*-tide) then are they not likely to continue, and thereofre are to be taken. \*v.c./*9.*n./*1./ Likewise al poore *v./* swarms, unlesse you meane to helpe them. Nether is it safe to trust any, after they have stoode five yeeres. 
\4 *The manner of killing Bees/*/ Having made choice of your stals to be killed, thus must you do. Earely in a morning before any Bees be abroad, or in an evening when al are come in, first digge a hoale in the groun as neere the stoole as may be, about six inches deepe and almost as wide as the hive-skirtes. Then having a litle sticke whose length is more then the semi-diameter of the pit, out a brimstone-match in the one end being slit, and the other end beeing shript sticke into the side of the hoale, so that the match may lande tight in the midle. This match is to be made of a linnen rag, wound in a fashion of a candle, & dipt in melted brinstone, after the maner that [cw: maides]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

maides amke sluts. When you have fired this at the upper end, set over the hive and presentlie shut it so close at the skirtes, that none of the smoake maie come forth. So shal you have them al dead in lesse then a quarter of an howre. 
\5 *Sundrie meanes to kill Bees./*/ Next unto the brimstone is the smoake of tuchwood, or puckfists used in like manner: but they are neither so quicke nor so sweete. And for a need some smother them with danke straw or hay: but then the hony wil smel of the smoake. And therfore some for want of brimstone, tuch-wood or puckfists, will drowne them in a tub of water: but that hurteth the hony, & doth the hive no good: and besides that, many of the Bees being not quite dead wil sting them that handle the hony. Therefore he that hath Bees must not lacke those forsaid necessaries. 
\6 *How to take the combes when the Bees are dead/*/ The Bees being dead, squat the hive softly against the grounf upon his sides: and then having loosed the ends of al the spleets, you maie easily take out the combes togither. 
\7 *Bees not to be killed when some are abroad./*/ Some careles honi-men will take your Bees at any time of the daie, when many of them are abroad: the which at their returne finding all gone, presentlie invade the next. And some wil carry away the Bees alive, and either willingly or against their wils let many out: which returning home will likewise trouble the next stals, and having begin sil set others a worke. It behoveth you therefore to prevent this danger, if [cw: you]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

you may. But if at any time you be thus served, the Bees will first come to the stoole where they stood, and settle there: where, if you attend a while, you maie kil most of them.
\8 *The second kind of vindemiation./*/ An other way to take the combes is by driving the Bees. The maner of it is this. At Mid-sommer, or wihin two or three daies after, in a faire morning an hower before sunrising, lift the stalle from the stoole, and set it upright & fast on the ground by some staies \9 *The time & maner of driving Bees./*/ with the bottome upward & then quickle set on the emptie hive, having first layed two spleetes upon the full hives bottome, that the emptie hive may stand the faster. And so wrapping a Mantle round about the chinke or meeting of both the hives, and binding it fast with a smale cord above and beneath, that a Bee may not get forth, knock the ful hive round about a good many times, pawsing now and then a little betweene, that the Bees may ascend into the void hive. And when you thinke that most of them are driven up (which wilbe about half an houre after) set the upper hive upon the old stoole, & knock the Bees that remaine, out of the nether hive upon a tablet two or three foot square, set close to the forpart of the old stool, that thence they may walke into their new home. When so you have got forth as many as you can, carry the hive away from place to place every now & [cw: then] 

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

then knocking the same. 
\10 *How to take the combs/*/ They which in the meane pace fly out, wil go to their fellowes. After a while, either without your garden or in the most remote part thereof, squat the hive a little on every side: and then, having loosed the spleetes ends, take out the combs one after another and wiping the Bees, that yet remaine, from each comb into a kever or other like vessel, send the combes as fast as you have wiped them into the house. And when you have done, set the kever and the emptie hive before the stoole: and in a while the Bees wil goe al together, and gather up cleane that little hony that is leaft. 
Provided alwaies, before you goe about this busines, that al the stalles in your garden bee first shut up, least they trouble you, and your poore Bees.
\11 *This driving of Bees unprofitable/*/ This kind of taking is much applauded at the first, because men thinke thereby to save both Bees, and hony. But it ofttimes falleth out with them, as it is in the proverb, *All comet all loose./* For the hony is neither so good, as being not yet in season, and to bee corrupted with the schadons, *v./* \*v.n./*2/ which can hardly bee cleane taken from it: neither so much by almost the one halfe, sith there remaine yet six of seaven weeks of the chiefest honi-gathering [cw: And]\12 *The hony taken is little & naught/*/

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

\13 *And the Bees driven fewe and poore./*/ And the Bees, as men forcibly driven from their goods and children, are so discouraged; that they seldome trhive after it: specially those that have swarmed, seeing their company is least but mal, and the after-brood is destroied, which should have supplied the roomes of them that are gone. And as for those that have not cast they might after that time yeeld a swarm, which would be better then the whole stal being driven: and if they did not swarme at al, then would they be so much the bettyer, either to take for hony or to keepe for store. 
The next yeere, if the stormy colde spring make not much spoile among them (for in such weather the best stals, as most bold, loose most of their company) they wil be sure to cast one very good swarme, if not two, and, when they have done, to yeeld good store of honie. 
\14 *An other kind of driving/*/ This driving of Bees into leere hive being nothing so profitable as it seemeth, I doe rather commend unto you the driving of one stal into another: whereby the fruit of one is taken and the lives of both are saved together. 
\15 *At 2 times/*/ And thus some are to be driven in *Libra,/* or rather in *Scorpio,/* because then other Bees will not be so busie and some in *Aquarius/* or *Pisces,/* before they begin to breed. 
\16 *Driving in Libra/*/ In *Libra/* such stalles onely are to be driven, as are fit to bee killed. *v./* and that into yeerelings or two-yeerelings, which that yeere have [cw: cast]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

castwise, and therefore have few Bees least in them; or into after-swarms, which have half-filled their hives with combes, and not much more: for if they have wrought them downe within a handfull of the stoole, they are sufficient in themselves. 
\17 *The manner of driving in Libra/*/ The maner of it is this. First move these two stalles, the *stranger/* that is driven, and the *receiver,/* as neere as may be one to another: & so let them stand together six or seaven daies, til they be well acquainted with their standings: and then, the weather being faire and constant, late in the evening, about ten or eleven a clock, set the stranger fast on the ground with his bottome upward, and the receiver upon him, & binde them close together as in the former driving. And then, by often clapping the stranger between your hands about the space of a quarter of an howre, now and then pausing betweene, having driven most of the Bees to the reciever, and so mingled them altogether, let them so stand til the morning. In the morning, an houre before sun rising if the weather be faire, otherwise you must stay longer, doe the like. This done, set the receiver upon the strangers stoole (but be sure to boister him up with three tilehsardes, that the driven Bees may easily get into the hive on every side) and then knock the stranger downe upon the table set before his stoole and by clapping of the [cw: hive]

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

hive presently, get as many of the Bees forth as you can. And forthwith cary the hive away from place to place & every when you be come to a newe place, and there have knocked out some Bees, leave there the stranger, and go directly to the receiver, and a little beyond: for the Bees wil follow you, and thereby the sooner recover the hive. When by this means you have wel nigh rid the stranger of his Bees, begin to take out the combs, proceeding as in the former driving, Assone as you have done, and the Bees begin to be quiet, take away the bolsters, & cloome up the receiver very close, leaving the dore no wider then must needes bee. And when they are quiet, let out your other Bees. 
\18 *How to revive those that are chilled in driving./*/ If, the wether being not warme, you finde some Bees to be chilled about the hive; fil your warme hands ful of them, and anone they will fly away to their fellowes, *v/* \*V.c./*7.*n./*58/ and if happily any of them chance to pricke you (which they will seldome do) your hand wil have the more vertue to revive the rest.
\19. *How to help those driven Bees that want./*/ If you thinke there be not sufficient provision for this double stal in that single hive, bestow a ful combe or twaine, *v./* \*V.c./*9 *n./*16/ as neede requireth, of the strangers upon them: and thus wil your Bees delight and prosper in new waxe, which in olde corrupte combes woulde decay: [cw:In]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

\20 *driving in Pisces/*/ In *Aquarius./* or *Pisces,/* when you have poised your hives, those that you find by their lightnes unlikely to endure the spring for lacke of food, you may in like maner drive into such provided stalles, as have fewest Bees: and so wil those receivers be much the better, & cast both the rather and the greater swarmes. And if by chance at any time after, you find a stal decayed, thus may you save them. 
This driving wil not be so troublesome as the former, because the poore Bees wil easily change their hungry home for a place of plenty. 
\21 *A third kind of vindimiation/*/ Exection or castration is a third kind of taking: which is the cuting out of part of the combes, part of being least for the Bees provision. And this was to bee done at two times in the yeere, *In ortu & occasu virgiliarum/*.
\22 *Exection used at two time./*/ *Virgiliarum ortus/* after *Columel l.9.c./*14. is the 48 day from *æquinoctium vernum/*: after *Var./*: the 44. but then you must understand that they accounted the *æquinoctium/* to be in the 8 degree of *Aries/* (although *Hipparchus/*, as Col. saith, had then found it to be the first) With us the comicall rising of *Vergiliæ/* or *Pleiades/* being 7 starres in the neck of *Taurus/*, and in the 24 degree of that signe, is knowne to be in the 3 of May, the 55 day after the true *æquinoctium/*: which jumpeth with the account of *Columella./* And *Vergiliarum occasus/*, being in the same degree of the opposite signe, is upon the 5. day of Novemb.

\l.9.c.15/ lumella *dum adhuc rura pastionibus abundant, quinta pars favorum; posteriore cum iam metuitur hyems, tertia relinquinda est./* But *Varro/* then requireth for their store two third parts; *ut ne plus tertia pars exacatur mellis, reliquum hyemationi relinquatur/*. And *Aristotle/* because (as Col. granteth) *hic modus non est in omnibus regionibus certus/*, doth not prescribe any certaine part, but leaving it to the discretion of the Bee-master, saith, *Cum favos apiarii eximunt, cibitantum relinquant, quantum per hymem sufficiat: quod si satis sit, servatur examen; sin minus, vel moritur ibidem (sive dicedat hyems abstet) vel de ferat sedem, si serenum nanciscitur./*
\24 *Exsection ancient, but not profitable. Neither first./*/ This way of taking, as appeareth, was anciently used in plentifill countries, as Greece, Scicilie, Italie, &c. But the former exsection, to wit in the spring, *Aristotle/* no where mentioneth: and surely it must needs doe more harme then good, seeing the hives are then full of schadons which being spild, spilleth their swarming; and the store of hony, which they seeke for, is then wel spent. 
\25 *Nor second/*/ And also in the autumne (which yet is the fitter time) seemeth no lesse unprofitable then troublesome; because the Bees in the spring following, if they lack not hony to live on, yet shal they lacke celles to lay their yong in, wher by their breed wilbe hindered. And at nether time can it be don without much spoil of bees. [cw: But]

##*The second part of this Chapter sheweth the trying of hony and wax with the making of methe./*/##

\1. *The combes to be broken into 3 parts./*/ THE combs being taken forth break then presentlie, while they are warme, into three parts: the first cleane hony & wax: the second hony and wax without stopping: the third wax without hony. But that they maie breake right where you would have them, first marke them out with the edge of your knife. 
\2 *The dressing of the first part for hony/*/ The first part breake into a hair-sieve set over a pan, bowle, or other fast vessell that maie hold it (Cooper-ware wil leake though it bee wel jointed) and so let the live-hony, *v./* \*v.c./*6*n./*27./ run of it owne accord, so long as it wil: when it ceaseth running, breake the pieces and let them run againe: and lastly with a warme sharpe knife cut those pieces at hurt the cels, & so let them run the third time.

\4 *How to know good hony/*/ *omni melle que p se sluit ut mustum oleunque appellaturque acæton, maxime laudabile est/*. \Nat. hist. li. II.c.15/ Which you shall finde to have these properties: cleere, odoriferous, yelow like gold, (unlesse it be virgin hony, for that is more chrystalline) sharpe, sweet, & pleasant to the tast, of a mean consistence betweene thicke & thin, so clammy that beeing taken up upon your fingers ende, in falling it wil not part but hang downe togither like a long string, as that useth to do which is clarified. \L.I.de medicam.simp delectu./ And such doth *Jacobus Sylvius/* describe the best hony to be. *Meloptimus sit purum adeo ut totum perluceat, odorum, flavum, acerrimus, dulcissimumque gustanti & jucundissimum, consistentia nec crassam nec liquidam, sed tam sibi coharens ut continuitatem suam, quasi linea longissima, non intercisum servet, si digito attollitur idem coquendo paucam spumam emittit./* \5 *The best hony is the bottome./*/ But alwaies the best part of this best hony is that which is lowest in the vessell. For as the best oile is in the top, and the best wine in the middle; so the best hony is in the bottome. \Hist. an.l.9.c.40./ *Mellis exilior pars fluitat, quæ eximenda est: pura vero & valida subsidit./*
As among liquours oile excelleth in lightnes & hony in heavines; so in both, that part is Left which excelleth in his excelling qualitie: & wine being of a midling weight is best in the middle. The weight of these three one to another hath this proportion. Oile is not so heavy as wine by one tenth part: for if you fil a measure with wine and divide it into ten parts, the same measure of oile is no heavier then nine of them. And hony is heavier then wine [cw: by]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

by the halfe: for if you fill a measure with wine, the same measure of hony wil weigh that & halfe so much more. *Quoniam oleum le vins est vino parte nonam, mel very gravius vino parte dimidiam; que? mensura capis mellis uncias 15 capis vini uncias 10, & otei 9... Fern meth/* 4.c.6. 
\6 *Corn-hony the best./*/ This hony when it hath wrought & settles, specially that which is in the bottome, will in time grow like unto the corne hony in the uppermost parts of the combes, hard and white: which indeed is the very best, *v./* if it coulde be got forth in his kinde: such as is the honie of *Spaine/* and *Narbona/*, in *France/*, which is counted the chiefest, and compared with that of *Hymettus/* & *Hybla/*.
*Quin Hispani & Narbonenses mistunt albissimum & longem prostanti Timum idenquw prædurum/* Sylv *l./*I.*med./*
*Nec Attico aut/* [FILL]
The rest of the third part pound with a pestle, or crush often with your hands al to pieces, & let it run as before. \7 *The second shoot is course hony./*/ When it hath done, put this second shoot being but course hony, in a pot by it selfe, and that which remaineth in the sieve unto the seconde part of your combs for methe. 
\8 *Corn-hony got out by water or fire/*/ If there be any store of stone-hony, and you be loth to wash it into the meth-liquor, set it in some vessel over a soft fire, and stil keep your hand in the vessel stirring about the honie and wax, and opening the wax piece-meale until the hony and not the wax shalbe molten: and then powre out all into a strainer, & wring out [cw: the] [L3]

the hony: But thus this good hony wil become but course: and therefore put it to the second shoot, and that least in the strainer to the second part. Otherwise you may clarifie it wel enough *v.part./*3.*n./*8.
\9 *Most make but one shoot & so mar al/*/ But the most part, partly for that they are loath to stand long about it, and partly that the live-hony might be a meanes to get out some of the hard or stonehony, doe use al alike. For when they have pounded it altogether, they hang it up in a thin hearen bagge, and thence let it run into a vessel, & some (which is worse) doe violently presse it out. But by these means they shal have no fine & pure raw hony, howsoever afterward they handle it. 
\10 * The working of hony, and how to helpe it./*/ The hony being put up into  pots, wil in two or three daies worke up a skum, of wax, hony, & drosse together: which, being taken of with a spoone, but to the second part now dissolved in water. In cold weather the hony wil not worke wel without the heate of the fire. The best way is to put it into an oven after the batch is forth, but not before you can abide to hold your hand upon the bottome, for feare of over-heating the hony. 
\11 *The dressing of the 2 parts for meth/*/ The second part of the combes you must first rid of the stopping as neere as you can, cutting of that which is by it selfe, & picking out that which is among the hony: al which refuse, because of the wax that is with it, cast to the [cw: third]

And thus shall you loose none of your hony. 
\13 *How to know when it is strong enough/*/ If the liquor be not strong enough to beare an egge the breadth of a two-pence above it, then put so much of your course hony into it, as wil give it that strength: or rather, when it is so strong powre in more water (stirring it with the liquor) until the egge sinke. If any many thinke this to be too smale; it may be amended in the boiling: which (as anon is shewed) wil give it what strength you wil, and cleerenesse withal. After this, stirre it wel together twise a day until the skum of the hony be ready to put to it. *v/* \*v.n./*10./ which when you have added, and have likewise stirred it about the vessel, as soone as it is setled, straine it againe through the clensieve.

\14 *What proportion of water to honie./*/ must you adde a proportionable measure of water and hony: namely fowr of that, for one of this. 
\15 *How & how long the liquor must be boiled./*/ The liquor being thus prepared let seeth an houre or better, even to the wasting of one fourth part, or as long as it wil yeeld any skums which you mjust continually take from it, as fast as it riseth. For if it once sink down againe, the liquor wil not be cleere without putting in some cold liquor to raise it. And therefore it is good to keepe backe some eighth part of the liquor, and, when the rest hath boiled about half an howre and is wel skimmed, to powre in that cold liquor, & to skim it cleane againe. 
\16 *A receipt of spice to bee added./*/When it wil cast no more skum, take it from the fire, and set it a cooling.

(18) \2 *As well outwardly as inwardly received/*/ It raiseth humours to the upmost parts, and therefore is fitly laid to fowle ulcers: (19) it helpeth the griefes of the iawes, (20) the kernels growing within the mouth, (21) & the squinancie or inflammation of the muscle of the inner gargil, for which purple it is gardgarized, \*Stomache. Angina/*/ & the mouth washed therwith: (22) it is drunke against the biting of a serpent (23) or mad dog: and (24), it is good for them which have eaten mushrooms, (25) or drunke popy; against which evil yet, rosed hony is taken warme. (26 It is also good for the falling sicknes, and better then wine, because it cannot arise to the head, as the wine doth. (27) Lastly it is a remedy against a surfet: for they that are skilful in physicke, when they perceive any mans stomach to bee overcome, they first ease it by vomit: & then, to settle his braine and to stay the noysome fume from ascending to his head, they give him honie upon bread. In respect of which great vertues (28) the right composition of those great antidotes *Treacle/* & *Mithridate/* requireth thrise so much hony, as of al other simples.

(2) To yong men, and those that are of a hot constitution it is not so good, because it is easily turned into choler: & yet *Lobel/* saith we know that hony taken fasting doeth much good unto some natures, which have hot livers: and in this point he preferreth our English hony.

\7 *Two waies to clarifie hony./*/ You may boile hony either by it selfe, or else with the like quantity of water, or other liquor. But alwaies in boiling skim it, that it may bee pure. By it selfe you must boile it untill it wil [cw: yeeld]

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$

yeeld no more skum. 
The right skum, which is drosse, is short and brittle: which when it is cleane taken awaie, the force of the fire wil cause the very hony to rise up like a skum, but that will then be tougher and more clammie then the drossie skum, and so wil al the rest be, when it is cold, as being over-boiled: therefore be sure to take it of in time. 
(which wil be about halfe an houre) and that with a very soft fire, or in a double vessel, lest, by over-heating, it get a bitter tast, and lest it soddainly run over and flame. 
With water it is to be boiled an houre at the least, even until the water be evaporated: which thing is knowne by the bubbles that rise from the bottom, & by the wasting of the one halfe: then, to make it more pure, put into every pound of hony the!!a/!! \!!a/!!Less white may serve if the hony be good./ white of one egge, and afterward skim it againe in the boiling. The fire may be more fervent at the first, but toward the end it must be slack: for it is then apt to be set on fire, as the meere hony, and to become bitter with violent heate. 
\8 *How to clarifie stone-hony./*/ If you will clarifie the stone-hony remaining in the combs, thus doe. When you have pared away as much of the wax as you may, breake the hony combes into a vessel to boile: and then powre faire water into it, until the water rise an inch or twaine above the bottome. When you have set this over the fire, stirre it together ever now and then: as soone as it is al melted and beginneth to boile, take it of and [cw: straine] 

===

$*Of the fruit, & profit of Bees./*/$ straine it, and then set it over a soft fire againe, & skim it cleane, unto the skum put faire warm water: when you have stirred it about, crush the wax together in your hand, and lay it aside: & the water (if you make no meth) either give it to your Bees, or, having boiled and skimmed it, put it to your brewlock. 
The course hony being boiled and clarified hath a most pleasant & delicate tast, & is comparable for most uses to the purest bottome-hony being raw. 
Which pure hony if you be disposed to boil it, wil aske lesse time to be clarified, as yeelding little or no skum at all, and in tast & vertue it is more excellent.
When your hony is boiled enough, take it from the fire, and rather too soone, and then too late: for if there be any drosse remaining, you shall find it in the top, when it is cold: but overmuch boiling consumeth the spiritous parts of the hony, and turneth. the sweet tast into bitter. 
\9 *The quintessence of hony/*/ And such is hony in his owne kind, both raw and boiled. It is also altered by distillation into a water. Which *Raimundus Lullius/* that excellent Chymist calleth the quintessence of hony. This quintessence dissolveth gold, & maketh it potable, & likewise any sort of pretious stone that is put therein. It is of much vertue that [cw: if] [M]

if any be dying, and drink 2 or 3 drame therof, presently he wil revive. If you wash any wound therewith, or other fore; it wil heal quickly. It is also good against the cough, catarre, & paines of the melt, and against many other diseases. Being given for the space of 46 daies together to one that hath the palsie, it helpeth him. Which thing *John Hester/* a practical Chymist, in his key of Philosophie professeth himselfe to have proved. It helpeth also the falling sicknesse, and preserveth the body from putrifaction. Of so marvellous efficacie is this water. 
\11 *The making of it/*/ The making of is is after this manner. Take two pound of perfect pure hony and put it into a great glasse, that foure parts of five may remaine emptie: !!a/!!lute it wel with a head & receiver, and give it fire until there appeare certaine white fumes, which, by laying wet clothes on the receiver and head and changing them when they are warme, wil turne into a water of a red colour like blood. \!!a/!!The lute may be made of clay, flocks, & salt-water, tempered together or of meal and whites of egges./ When it is al distille, keepe the receaver close shut, and let it stand til it be cleere, and of the colour of a rubie. Then distil it in *Balneo Mariæ/* seaven times, and so it wil loose this redish colour, and become yelow as gold, having a great smel & exceeding pleasant.

with many ofhter simples, which heere to declare would seeme but tedious and impertinent. Notwithstanding it shal not be amisse in 2 or 3 instances to give you a tast of such confections: and first of those that are inwardly, then of those that are outwardly received. 
Of the first sort are marmalade, and marchpane, preserved fruits, as plums, &cheries: &c. Conserves of roses, violets, &c. with syrups of the like matter. 
\13 *Marmalade made of hony/*/ Marmalade is thus made. First boile your quinces in their skins til they be soft, then having pared and strained them, mix therewith the like quantitie of clarified hony, and boile this togither til it be so thick, that in stirring (for you must continually stirre it for feare of burning) you may see the bottom, or being cooled on a trencher, it be thick enoug to slise: then take it up and box it speedily. \Fernel method l.7.de legmatis/ This is very good to comfort and strengthen the stomake. For want of quinces you may take wardens, peares, or aples, and specially the pear-maine, giliflower, pipim, and roial. 
\14 *Marchpane/*/ Marchpane may be made after this manner. Botle and clarifie by it selfe, so much hony as you think meet: when it is cold, take to every pound of hony the white of an egge, and beare them together and wax white, and when you have boiled it againe 2 or 3 walmes upon a fire of [cw: coles] [M2]

coles, continually stirring it, then put to it such quantity of almonds stamped as shall make it of a just consistence: and after a warme or two more, when it is wel mixt, powre it out uppon a table, and make up your marchpane. This is good for the consumption. 
\15 *Preserves/*/ *Preserve fruits after this manner./* 
The damascens, or other frui, being gathered fesh from the tree; faire, & in their prime; neither greene nor sower, nor over-ripe or sweet; with their stalkes, but cut short: weigh them, & take their weight in raw fine hony: putting to the hony the like quantity of faire water, boil it some halfe quarter of an howre, or til it will yeeld no skum: then having slit the damascens into the dented side for feare of breaking, boile them in this liquor til the meate commeth clean from the stone, & then take them up. If the liquor be then to thin, boile it more: if in the boiling it be to thick,put in more faire water, or rose-water if you like it. The liquor being  a fit consistence, lay up and preserve therein your fruits. 
\16 *Conserves/*/ Conserves of Roses is thus to be made. Take of the joice of fresh red roses 1 ounce, of fine hony !!a/!! \*Metrosatum/* !!a/!!Cum unci is aque tribus mediocriter despumeter. v. n. 7/ clarified 10 ounces, boile this together: when it beginneth to boile, adde of the leaves of fresh red roses clipt with scissors in little pieces 4 ounces, boile them to the consumption of the joice, and presently put up the conserves into some earthen vessel: keepe it long therein [cw: for]

\17 *Syrups. Syrup of roses/*/ After the same maner is made conserves of violets. Syrup of Roses make thus. Stiep fresh roses in hote water, the vessel being covered: when the water is cold, straine out the roses, &, heating the water againe, siep other roses therein this doe so often til the water be red. And this being purged with whites of egges, boile it with like quantitie of fine hony, until it be of convenient thicknes. If you prepare it for present uses, the lesse boiling wil serve, if you meane to keepe it, it requireth more, for which purpose the sunning of it is good: This purgeth a little, specially being new. \Sylv. med. simpl. mist. l3. Sylv. ibid./ 
Or thus. Stiep one pound of red rose leaves in 4 pound of water 24 howres. When the water is strained, put unto it 2 pound of fine hony, and boile it to the thicknesse of a syrup, taking of the skum as it riseth. It tempereth the hot affections of the braine, it quencheth thirst, it strengthneth the stomake, it procureth sleep, & staieth this rheumes, *Fern. Meth.lib.7./* 
*Syrup of violets/* The syrup of violets is made, after the same maner of fragrant violets a litle dried in the shade. Being wel boiled it may be kept a yeere without vinewing or corruption. It tempereth and purgeth hot and sharp humours; and therefore is good in a pleurisie: it expelleth melanchollie and the effects thereof, as headach, wa [king] [M3]

The which, by the purifying in boiling, together with the accesse of sundry wholsome spices and herbes, are rather confirmed & increased, then any way extenuated or diminished. Therefore saith Lobel, *Mulsum, ubi aquæ plurimum, mellis non multum, diuturnam intestinaque mellis ebullitione in vinum longem utilissimum abis./* And Pictorius, *Hydromel longæ vetustate transit in vinum stomache convenientissimum./* Meth, when it is olde, is a wine most agreeable to the stomake: it recovereth 1 the appetite being lost, it 2. openneth the passage of the spirit or breath, it 3 softneth the bellie, it 4 is good for them that have the cough. 5 If a man take meth, not as his ordinarie drink, but, as physick, now and then; he shal receive much benefit by it, against quartan agues, against cacexies, and against the diseases of the braine, as *analepsie,/* & *epilepsie,/* or the falling evill: for which wine is pernicious: it 6 cureth the yelow jaundice: it 7 is also good against henbane with milke, and against the winter-cherie, it 8 nourisheth the body, 9 So that many have attained to long old age, only by the nourishment of meth.

These cakes hang in the open aire upon a line drawne through them, so that they may not touch one an other, besprinkling them with water in the sun-shine until they be white.

But those that are smal, this oile healeth in 3. or 4. daies, by annointing only the wound therwith, and laying on a cloath wet in the same. It stayeth the sheding of the haire, either on the head or beard, by annointing the place therewith. 
Also for inwarde diseases, this oile worketh miracles, if you give one drachme at a time to drinke with white wine: for it is excellent in provoking urine which is stopped, it helpeth stitches and paines in the loines, it helpeth the cold gout, or sciatica, and all other griefes comming of cold.

of the church, wil say, The paying of tithes was commanded by the law of Moses, but in the time of gospel it is not necessary: A competent exhibition indeed is to bee allotted to the clergie for their maintenance; but that may be better effected by other meanes, then by tithes. As though the foolishness of men were wiser then the wisdome of God: as though men in their blind and uncertaine imaginations could devise a better way for the continuall maintenance of the ministery and serive of God, then that which himselfe in his provident and al-seeing wisdome hath appointed.
This competent maintenance (as one wel saith) is a Castle built in the aire, which never yet stood upon the earth. It has beene indeed attempted in many places: but what is done? The tithes are wickedly wrestled from the true owners, and competent maintenance in liew therof, is a poore pittance (God wot), cut to the scantled, that it may serve only to keep them alive. Yea some of them are held in that base and contemptible state, that, to the great slaunder of the Gospel, and the scandell of the weaker sort, they are faine to goe from house to house for a morsel of bread. Can they think that God, who did sufficiently and liberally provide for the Priests under the law, hath least the Ministers of the glorious Gospel of Christ to the courtesie of them, which (as wofull ex- [cw: peti] [N]

Which do even straine their wits to the utmost, by one trick or other, to seaze upon their mangled portion, with griping talents to rent it piece-meale from them, and so, cruelly to prey upon them, which in the meane space doe pray for them? 
It cannot be denied that tithes were once the Lords, when it was said, \Lev.27.30/ *All the tith of the land, both of the seed of the ground and of the fruit of the trees, is the Lords, it is holy to the Lord./* If it were once his, why is it not his stil? Who is he that hath dispossessed him of his right? And if, being his, it were to be paid unto his servants the Priests and Levites, for the service of God under the law; why should it not likewise bee paied unto his servants the ministers of the word and sacraments, for the service of God under the law; why should it not likewise bee paies unto his servants the ministers of the same word and sacraments, for the service of the same God in the Gospel? Our saviour reproving the Scribes and Pharises, because they stood more upon the observation of the smaller duties of the law, then of those that were greater; saith unto them \Mat.23./ *Yee tithe mint & anise & cummin, & leave the weightier matters of the law, as judgement and mercy and fidelity/*; giving his sentence of them both, *These things ought you to have done and not to have leaft the other undone./* Where you may see that Christ himselfe commaundeth the paying of tithes, which are the smaller things; though hee prefer judgement and [cw: mer-]

mercy & fidelity, which are the greater things, of the moral & perpetuall law of God. So doth that ancient father *Origen/* expound these words of Christ, shewing that the commandement of paying tithes is to bee observed according to the letter, *Ut hæc observanda, etiam secundum luteram, ipsus Dei vocibus doceantur; dicit Dominus in evangelus, va vobis, &c. Vide ergo diligentius, quomodo sermo Domini vult fieri quidem omnimode quæ majora sunt legis, nontamen omitti & hæc quæ secundum literam designantur./* And therefore in the same place he saith, *Non mihi videtur buisimodi anima habere memoriam Dei, nec cogitare nec credere quia Deus dederit fructus quos cepit, quos ita recondit quasi alienos a Deo. Si enim a deo sibi datos crederet, sceret utique, munerando sacerdotes, honorare Deum de datis & muneribus suis./* Likewise S. *Cyprian/*, who lived in his time. After them *Chrysotome/*, and *Jerome/*, who hath many places to this purpose, as these, \In Mal.3.8./ *Quod de decimis diximus, quæ olim dabantur a populo sacerdotibus & Levitis, in ecclesiæ quoqe, populis intelligite./* And againe, *Ecclesiæ populis præceptum est dare decimus./* \Ibid./ Also S. *Ambrose/*, S. *Augustine/*, *Leo/* the first, *Gregorie/* the great, with the other good bishops of the Sea of Rome.

before and after have confirmed the same. 
So that this Catholike doctrine was alwaies taught and observed in the Church of Christ without controlement or contraditcion, untill that Antichrist sitting in the seate of God, but teaching doctrines of Devils, as hee corrupted other waightie points of christian religion, presumed also to change the right & ancient use of tithes, and translated them from the ordinary Pastors and Curats, unto regular or rather irregular Priests, which wickedly wasted them in idle Monasteries. 
But that lay men, which wait not at the altar, should lay their prophane hands upon the Lords portion and receive tithes, is such a sin, as the man of sinne himselfe would not attempt, and such an abhomination as in former ages among Christians or heathen the world never heard of; nor ever was knowne in this famous Iland, since first it imbraced the faith of Christ, until that strange act, whereby the Church was unmercifully spoiled, not only of hir lands, the gifts of men; but of hir tithes also, the gift of God. The fact of *Charles Martel/* in France was indeed more ancient? For there a portion of tithes was granted to this Champion for the defence of the Church, against the violent irruptions of the barbarous Gothes & Vandals, which would have robbed and ruined the Church: but here [cw: the] [N3]

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

the tithes were given to the robbers themselves. Since which time, they are so farre from restitution, or any remorse of the fact, that they daily thirst after that little which is leaft: and, like drunken men, the more they drinke, the drier they are. It is a world to see how witty & diligent they are in laying plots, which flufes and flights they invent and practise for the withholding of tithes: abusing the very laws to their purpose, and making even those to maintaine their sacrilege, which were made to a contrary ende. 
\An.45.Ed.3/ If in former times, when the land was so overgrowne with trees that it had enough for it selfe and other countries also, it were enacted, that *wheras men did sel their great wood to merchants to their owne profit, or in aide of the kind in his wars, and the merchants were impleaded in the spirituall court for the tithes of the said wood, whereby the owners cannot sell their woods to the very valew, to the great damage of them and of the realme: it is ordained that in this case a prohibition shal be granted. &c./* If this I say have been enacted, the the worde *great wood/* or timber trees, shalbe taken in the largest sense, and shal containe not only oake, elme, and ash; but beech also and maple, for they be trencher-timber, and with some withy also, for that is harow-timber, and I doubt not but in a while they wil have under-wood and al, & say tis fire timber, as in many places they have [cw: begun]

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

begunne already. And these trees shalbe tith-free, not body only, but bough also; not only when they are felled, but as often as they are lopped. Whereas, if the meaning of the statute may be knowne by the wordes, the statute giveth way to none of al these evils. For first, there is no mention at al in these words of any immunity or discharge of tithe: unles they wil say that wheresoever a prohibition is granted in a cause of tith, there he that sueth for tith must loose it: which, albeit the modern practise make it seeme probable, yet wil they not say that it is perpetual. But bee it so. Yet how doth this concerne the lops of trees which are cut from the standing stems, and serve not for timber but for fuel? Nay where are the trees themselves, as now they are used, freed from tith? It is ordained byt his law, that *wheras great wood is sold to merchants for the owners profit, or in aide of the king in his warres, &c. in this case a prohibition shalbe granted./* They therfore that would pay no tith must shew that their case is this case (which I think in these daies few can do) or els their trees are no more freed from tithing by this statute, then any other fruits of the earth: as good reason is they should not be, seeing God giveth the increase of them with so little cost & care. But even in this case, where the bodies were discharged of tith, because they were sold to the merchants (who, if they should pay for [cw: the] [N4]

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

the tith to the church, would not give the ful value of the timber to the seller, to the great damage of the Realme) the boughes were not exempted which were least behinde, for which the merchantes could not bee inpleaded; nor the Realme receive any great damage, if the parson made him a fire with the tenth part? 
If the law have said, that barren beach or wast ground, which before this time have been barren and paide no tith by reason of the same barrennes, being now improved and converted into arable grounde or medow, shall after seaven yeeres pay tith; this is sufficient reason for some, when they have grubbed up a few bushes or trees in a fat & fertil ground, to pay no tith thereof for seaven yeeres after: whereas indeed the law speaketh only of such ground, as *by reason of his barrennesse did pay no tithe./* But in the next proviso, it speaketh of ground that yeeldeth some tith. That cannot be understoode of tith that the grounde yeeldeth in any fruit: for then there would follow a manifest contradiction betweene the two provisoes, the first speaking of land, that, by reason of his barrennes, yeeldeth no tith: the seconde saying, that such land yeeldeth some tith: neither do the words of themselves import such meaning: for it is not said, *if any such ground have yeelded or brought forth any tithe: but if any such barren ground have bin charged to pay any tithe/* as it might formerly have beene, by some composition or [cw: agree-]

$*The conclusion to the Reader./*/$

agreement, either by it selfe, or in general with other land: though now, by reason of this barrennes, it yeels no tith *in specie./* But it is said in the later proviso, that it *shal pay that charged tithe during those seaven yeeres/*, and therefore no reason that it shoulde also pay the tith which it yeeldeth *in specie/* during the same time. True: for how should we blame them that pay lesse then the tith, if we would recieve more then the tithe, sith both are alike unjust. But the ecclesiastical law yet in force requiring the tithe *in specie/*, & this statute, requiring it according to a former rate, if by the benefit of either law wee take but one of them, we have but our due, which neither equity nor any law forbiddeth. These provisoes then concerne only such ground as, by reason of the barrennes thereof, yeeldeth no tith in fruit; though, by some agreement it might be charged to pay some kind of tith. But howsoever, this law is altogither affirmative, commanding, not forbidding the payment of tithe, as being made purposely in favour of the cleargy. For it doth not say, that seaven yeeres after the improvement it shal pay no tithe; but, leaving it for those seaven yeers *statu quo prius/*, doth ordein that after those seaven yeeres, notwithstanding any former agremeent or other pretence (*unlesse it were discharged by an act of parliament/*) it shal thence-forth pay tithe *in kind/*. So that the very letter of the law giveth no such advantage [cw: unto]

unto the evil disposed, that with any sense it can bee enforced against the good meaning of the law-makers, which, as appeareth by the title, preamble, and the whole tenor of the act, was made for the good (as it is said) of the clergy, & not for their hurt, as now, by the iniquity of the times, it is used. 
If the same law, for the true payment of personal tithes by the Merchants, Clothiers, Buyers and sellers, and other trades-men, shal but say, that it shal bee lawful to use all lawfull and reasonable meanes, *other then the parties owne corporall oath/*; this shal be an occasion unto many, yea, if not to all, to almost all, to discharge themselves of al such dues. For albeit the personal tithes of the husbandmen; yet they which by their trafike or trade have gained cleerely 40, 50, yea hundreds of pounds, are not ashamed to come to the Church at Easter, like poore day-labourers, with their bare two-peny-offering: but as for their tithes, because they cannot be put to their othes to say what they are, they keepe both the knowledge and paiment of them from the Priest, and make no reckoning at al to honour God *de datis & manneribus suis/*, out of his owne giftes and benefitess as if God were the God of the husbandmen only, and not of the trades-men; or as if they re [cw: ceived]

For otherwise with what face could they appeare before the Lord in his sanctuarie, and there, as chiefe members of his Church, take up the chiefest roomes; and yet contribute nothing towards his service and worship, in whome they live, and move, and have their being? 
If an other branch of the same act, to confirme the ancient both *right/* and *manner/* of tithing, shal say that *every of the Kings subjects shal pay their tithes truly and justly in their proper kinde, in such manner and forme as hath beene of right paid within/* 40 *yeeres next before the making of this act/*; this law shalbe wrested to maintaine the deteining of the greatest part of some tithes, that is, the withholding of tithes of a great value for the payment of trifles in liew thereof. (Whereas, if they would redeeme their tith, in equitie they should adde somewhat more.) \Lev.17.31/ And yet this Law, which is pretended to justifie this injurie, in the hardest constructuon that it may beare, can not imply any such matter, but doth indeed plainly command the contrary. For it doth not say they shal pay the twentieth, or the fortieth, or the hundreth part (as in some cases, by pretence of this law, some use to do) but they shall pay *the tithe/*, 1. the tenth part.

For some do tithe by sheafes cast here & there in the furrows: others tith by the hiles & shocks, the sheafes being gathered togither, &c. So that in these and the like, there cannot be kept an uniforme manner of paying tithe, although ther be this uniformity, that the whole tithe be paide without diminution. So then to use to pay lesse then the tithe, which by no law is alowed, is a custome not *in modo decimandi/*, but *in non decimando/*: for hee cannot bee saide to pay the tithe, that payeth but part of the tithe, unless it bee by the helpe of a *Synecdoche/*: \*Pars pro toto./*/ which trope in the matter of tithing is verie frequent. But, not withstanding the sense of the wordes & manifest meaning of both lawes, say it were a custome *in modo decimandi/*: yet, I hope, they will not say it is *a laudible usage or custome/* to steale a goose and sticke up a feather; to defraude a poor Vicar of his maintenance by keeping away his tith for a thing of nothing.

ces of things are so enhaunsed; that, if al tithes should be sold accordingly, he that is now able to give to him that asketh, would bee glad to aske, if any would give. If the lawyers should receive the rents of their purchased lands after this rate, they would surely have more pittie of their poore Pastors.
If any man therefore, by some over-reaching match or other pretense, have used to keepe back part of his tith; this cannot warrant him to doe so still (for a custome of sinning, doth not extenuat but aggrivate the sin) but should rather provoke him to make satisfaction at an other time, for the former wrong: and so surely would doe, if men did not preferre the worship of their earthly *Mammon/*, before the service of the God of heaven.
Thus you see how injuriously this good law is rakt, and made to speake that which it never meant. But this is not all: there is yet a farther use, or rather abuse made of it. The great ones, suppose Patrones, Justices, and other rich men wil not only hold that which they have fingered; but, by virtue of this law, or rather by the vice of their greedy mindes, doe practise dayly to make new customes.

If you demaund your due, their answer is, Wee have not used to pay any thing, nor any thing wil pay.

In the meane space give thou unto God the things that are Gods: withold not that part which is holy to the Lord: but pay justly the tithes of his blessings, & namely of the fruits of these commodious creatures. Then shal God destill plentie of hony-dewes unto thy Bees; and with the plentiful dew of heaven shall enrich the earth, that thou maist be enriched with the fruits thereof. They be the words of that holy Father S. *Augustine, Majores nostri ideo copiis omnibus abundabant quia Deo decimas dabant/*. Our \*Homel/*.48.50.*Homelicrum/*./ Our [cw: Fa-]

Fathers did therefore about in all riches, because they gave their tithes to God: whom if thou wilt no heere, yet heere the truth it selfe. \Mal.3.10/ *Bring yee al the tithes into the store-house: that there may be meate in mine house: and prove me now herewith (saith the Lord of hosts) if I wil not open the windowes of heaven, and powre you out a blessing without measure./*
Now if, not withstanding al this, against the uniforme doctrine and practise of the Church of Christ in the purer times, against the confirmations of godly Kinges and people, against the generall current of Fathers and Couucels teaching the law of the tithe to be perpetual according to the word of God as wel in the new testament as in the old, there be any so refractarie as yet to say, that tenth part, howsoever convenient, is not so necessarie but that it may be changed into a greater or better part, rather than taken into a lesse: that as the work of the Ministers is greater, better, and more glorious then of the Priests; so they might be more honoured, better regarded, and more liberally rewarded. But this kind of change is so unfitting to these mens purpose; that I think they would chuse rather to change their opinion, & reteine stil the Ancient Catholike doctrine of the Church, *Leges divinæ sacerdotibus & ministris ec-/* [cw:*clesiarum/*]
