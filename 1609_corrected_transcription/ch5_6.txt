##CHAP. 5/##

\1. *The parts of a swarme./*/ {T}He stocks having bred and filled their hives do send forth swarms. A swarme doth consist of al such partes as the stocke doth, namely of a queene-bee, hony-bees as wel old as yong, and drone bees. 
\2. *When you may see the queene-bee./*/ If any man desire to see the queene, he hath now opportunity, when she goeth forth with her swarme: *v.n./*27 and dead ones he may find many before the stooles when the stocks have cast their last swarmes, *v.n./*29. and also when many meete in one swarme, *v.c./*1.*n/*7.
\2 *The swarme no younger then the stocke./*/ Men thinke that the swarme consisteth only of yong Bees, and that the old Bees only tary behinde: but indeed (though it may seeme strange) the swarme is no younger, than the stocke: for there are in both of both sortes. The yong Bees remaine in the stock with the old for their defence and for the greatest labours, *v./* *V.c./*I.*n 55./*& the old ones go with the yonge in the swarme for their aid and guidance in their worke.

\*v.c./*4/ gation of their kinde. *v/* \4 *Many drones in a swarme a good signe./*/ And therefore those swarmes that have many drones wil surely prosper: and if they be rathe wil swarme againe, unlesse they bee over-hived: whereas those that have fewe or none, will increase little or nothing all the sommer after. 
\5 *A kinde spring for swarmes./*/ A warme, calme, and showring spring causeth many & rathe swarmes: whereas dry, windy, and cold-stormy wether doth then worke contrary effects. For it both hindereth the breeding, because the old Bees at such times wil go little abroad, and when they do, they find smal state in the flowers; and also destroyeth the breed, because the tender fry adventuring into the ungentle aire, are so beaten & chilled upon a sodaine, that few are able to recover the hive. 
\His l.5.c.22./ \Nat hist li.II.c.17.6/ *Augent mella siccitates, sobolem imbres. Humide vere melior fœtus, sicco mel copiosius./*
\6 *Swarming wether/*/ Likewise in warme and calme weather the swarmes delighte to arise, but specially in a gloome after a showre; in extreme hot and dry wether not so: *v/* \*V.n./*19./ in so much that stals being ful and ready to swarme with the first, are somtime so kept backe with cold dry windes in *Gemini,/* and with extreme heat & drought in *Cancer,/* that they have not swarmed at al that yeere.
\7 *The swarming howres/*/The swarmes use to come forth betweene the howres of nine and three, but chieflie betweene eleven and one. They choose rather the forenoone if the wether please them: other [cw: wise]

===

$*and the hiving of them/*/$

wise they will stay for a faire howre in the afternoone. This time of the day therefore in the swarming months your Bees must continually be attended.
\8 *The two swarming monthes./*/ The swarming months are two, *Gemini/* and *Cancer/*: one month before the longest day, and an other after. I have heard of a swarme upon *S. James/* his day, but surely those Bees had forgot themselves. \9 *Rathe swarmes./*/ Those that come in the ascending of the sun betweene *Gemini/* & *Cancer/* are rathe swarmes. \10 *Late swarms/*/ Those that come in the descending betweene *Cancer/* & *Leo/* are late swarmes. But there are fewe that come in the first fortnight, and they very good, few also in the last fortnight, namely after *S. Peters/*-tide, and they very bad. Yet the backwardnesse of the yeere, when it happeneth, may mend them much. 
Those that swarme before the blowing of knap-weed, come in very good time, before the blowing of blackberies they may live and doe wel, but blackbery-swarmes are seldome to be kept, unlesse you meane to feede or drive them. \11 *Black-berie swarmes are seldome to be kept./*/ For they are more likely to die then to live: & if they live, they will not swarme the next yeere. And moreover they weaken the stocks from whence they came, which otherwise would swarme betime the yeere following, and then one such swarme  is worth three of those lateward ones. Wherefore prevent their rising, *v.c./*3.*n/*.32. [cw:An]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

\12 *A prime swarme & an afterswarme naturall/*/ An old stal ful, or yeereling welnight ful doth naturally & usually cast twise, a prime-swarme & an after-swarme: although some full stals do not cast once, some but once, and some having many princes (specially when the prime-swarme is broken) doe cast three or fowre times. \13 *A stalle may cast 4. times./*/ For sometime it happeneth that in the going foorth of the swarme a blacke clowde rising stayeth parte of them that are alreadie come foorth, and lie about the hives-dore: \14 *Divers causes of breaking the prime swarm/*/ sometime when they are al uppe either fearing a clowde, or disliking the lighting-place, or being troubled in the hyving, parte doeth returne.
\15 One prime-swarme is worth two or three after-swarmes./ One prime-swarme is worth two or three after swarmes, except it be broken: and then if the residue come foorth in one entire swarme, that after-swarme may bee the better of the twaine: but if it bee divided into two or three, then will they all bee but indifferent, which can hardelie live till the nexte sommer: and therefore must either bee taken or fedde: except you put them to some other. 
\16 *The vulgar Bees appoint the rising of the fore-swarmes, & that upon 4 grounds./*/ The choice of the time when the first colonies, or prime-swarmes thall goe foorth, the rulers referre unto the commons: who by reason of their continuall travell and businesse both without and within, doe best knowe when all thinges are readie and fit for them: [cw: First]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

First within they will bee sure that they have a Prince readie to goe with them, for without a governor they will not bee. Then that their hive bee full, so that it maie bee divided at the least into two or three sufficient companies: one to remaine with *Marthesia/* the olde queene, an other to go forth with *Antiope/* the prince, and a third happylie, which together with the unripe brood in the celles maie make an other swarme to serve *Orythia/*. Without likewise they wil see, first that the flowers be in state presentlie to furnish them with store of wax and honie:then that the wether doe please them, as being warme, and calme, and moist, unlesse, being continuallie unseasonable, they have no choice. 
\17 *Five signes of the first swarming./*/ When the hives begin to be ful, they will dronie, or yeelde foorth fledge drones: which is a signe that the first broode of nymphes have beene a good while flying abroade, and are now able to endure both weather and labour. *v.c./*4.*n./*16.
Other signes of the hives fulnesse and readinesse to swarme are at the hive-dore. First the Bees hovering in colde eveninges and mornings. Secondlie the moistnesse or sweating uppon the stoole. Thirdly their hastye running uppe and downe. Fourthlye their first lying foorth in foggie and sultrie [cw: mor-]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

mornings and evnings & going in againe when the aire is cleere. But this last signe is seldome seene in temperate weather. 
\18 *The signe of present swarming./*/ Sometime, when they swarme, they fly away as fast as they come forth: but for the most part they first gather together without at the dore not only upon the hivel, but upon the stoole also: where when you see them begin to hang one upon another in swarming time *v./* \*v.n./*7/ & to grow into a cluster that covereth the stoole in any place;then be sure they will presently rise, if the weather hold. The first that come forth will increase that cluster to some fourth part of the swarme and then begin they to fly away first out of the hive, and after from the cluster:&c. *v.n./*27.
But here you must note that as to fill the hives dore, or to ly forth a little now and then in foggie or sultrie mornings and evnings (which is because then they are most offended by heate within and can best indure the aire abroad) & otherwise to goe in againe, is a signe that the hive is full, and therefore are like to swarme shortly after; \19 *To ly forth continually is a signe they will not swarme./*/ so to ly forth continually (as in extreame hot and and dry sommers they use to doe) under the stock or behind the hive &c. specially after *Cancer/* is come in, is a meanes to hinder their swarming. For the Bees knowing by nature that the greatest companies doe prosper best; until they find themselves so pes [cw:tred]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

tred with heate and throng of multitudes that the hive can scarce hold any more, wil have no mind to swarme. And when they have once taken to ly forth, the hive wil alwaies seem empty, as though they wanted company. 
\20 *How to remedy their lying forth/*/ To remedie this, you must in hot weather keep the hives as coole as may be, by watering and shadowing both them & the place where they stand. 
If this cause them not to keepe in; then about eight or nine of the clocke in cleere and calme weather, drive them gently into their hives with your brush *v./* \*v.n./*39/ and ever now and then powring a little water downe the forepart of the hive, keepe the doore coole and moist until either the Bees bee gon in or it be about 10 a clock: afterward let them doe what they list: happily (if the wether like them) they wil come forth and swarme: unlesse they have no prince to goe with them, without whom they never remove. Thus may you try them 5 or 6 daies so it be before Midsommer, and before the honydewes be rife: for is it pitie they should loose their part of them. Therefore if by that time they swarme not, suffer them no longer: but if the stall be a yeareling, reare the hive and let the Bees in: and then wil they enlarge their combs and gather hony which before lay idle abroad, and increase almost to as much profit as if they had swarmed, by the next yeeres [cw: great] 

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

great and timely swarmes. But if the stall be of many yeeres, then turning the bottome of the hive upward set a leere prepared hive fast upon it: into which they wil ascend and worke and breede there as well as in the old. At *Libra/* you may drive *v./* \*v.c./*10.*par./*1.*n./*17./ them all into the new hive, and take the old for your labour. 
\21 *The signes of after swarmes/*/ The signes of the after-swarmes are more certaine. For whereas the rising of the prime-swarme is appointed by the uncertaine vulgar, whose chiefe direction is the fulnes of the hive; the hive being now well emptied, for other swarmes there needeth some other warning, \22 *The rising of the after-swarmes is appointed by the rulers./*/ which the rulers themselves doe give by their voices: without which that stock will swarme no more that yeere. And yet the choice of the hower, yea and of the day among foure or five is permitted unto them, as best knowing the disposition of the weather. 
\23 *When they begin to call or sing./*/ When the prime-swarme is gon (if the stock shal swarme any more) the seaventh or eight evening after, sometime the ninth, tenth, or eleventh, the next prince, when she perceiveth a competent number to be fledge and ready, beginneth the musick in a begging tune; as if she did pray her queen-mother to let them go: whereunto if she yeeld consent by hir answering (as to the petition of hir second daughter she seldom saith nay, though sometime shee consent not in two or three daies) then looke [cw: for]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

for a swarme: which seldome ariseth the next day, unlesse the weather be very pleasant: but after two or three daies they will accept indifferent weather. I have not knowne any stay after the fift day. 
\14 *The Bees musicke./*/ They sing both in triple time: the princess thus 

{Musical notation} 

with more or fewer notes, as she pleaseth. And sometime she taketh a higher key, specially toward their comming forth, and beginning the od minim in *Alami re/* shee tuneth the rest of hir notes in *C sol fa/* thus, 

{Musical notation}

But the Queene in a deeper voice thus;

{Musical notation}

continuing the same, some foure or five semi-briefes, and sounding the end of the every note in *C sol fa ut./* So that when they sing together, sometime they agree in a *perfect third,/* sometime in a *Diapente/*, & (if you respect the termination of the base) sometime in a *Diapasso/*. With these tunes answering one another, and some [cw: pauses] [F]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

pawses betweene they goe solemnly round about the hive, so to give warning unto all the company. \25 *When you may best heare it./*/ This they continue daily untill their swarming but you may heare them best in the evenings and mornings. If there be many of the Queenes breed that are ripe, they will joine withher in hir tune, the more to incite the swarme to goe, that their turne may come the sooner: I have heard three of them together. But none dare counterfeit the voice of the Prince: for that were treason to hir person. And yet sometime one of them, in hope to part the swarme, wil steal out with her: but if the swarm be not parted, or being parted be put together in one hive, it costeth her hir life. *v.c./*1.*n./*7.
\26 *Before the Bees swarme the voices come downe to the stoole./*/ In the morning before the swarme come abroad, these Princes come downe neerer the stoole and there they hold on their melodie somewhat longer, singing sometime above 20 notes togither, and with shorter pauses.
\27 *The manner of their swarming/*/ At the very swarming time they descend to the stoole: where answering one another in more earnest manner, with thicker and shriller notes, the mainie begins to march along, thronging one another for hast, and buzzing with their winges in great jolitie.
As soone as those galant Nymphs are aloft, they doe most nimbly bestirre themselves sporting and playing in and out as if they were dancing the hay, in this manner waiting for the [cw: com-] 

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

comming of their Prince. Now when some two third parts or three fourth partes of the swarme is passed, the musick ceaseth, and then commeth forth this stately dame *Orythia/*: who walking two or three turnes before the dore, of purpose you would thinke to be seene, she takes hir leave, leaving but a smale traine to follow hir: which high them after as fast as they can. This decent order the great Lords of the earth seeme to have learned of this little Lady: who in their country progresses, goings to Parliament, and other solemne processions, doe send the greatest and fairest part of their retinew before them, having behinde but a smale troope of necessarie attendants to gard their persons. 

\28 *The prime-swarme being broken, the next may call and swarm within the eighth daie./*/ If the prime-swarme be broken, the second will both call, and swarme sooner: and by that occasion happily a third also may rise, yea and sometime a fourth but all within a fortnight after the prime-swarme. \29 *All the swarmes of one hive come within a fortnight/*/ After the second swarm I have heard a yong Lady-bee call: but the Queene not willing to part with any more of hir company did not answer: and the next day she with seaven more were brought forth dead. *v/* \*v.c./*1.*n./*7./

\30 *What to do when a swarm is up./*/ When a swarme is up, it is a common fashion to make a harsh noise with a pan, kettle, bason, or other like thing, thereby to stay them from flying away. Which indeed is no new thing, as being used in *Aristotle/* his times *Gau-/* [cw: *dere/*]
[F2]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

*dere etiam plausu/* (saith he) *atque sonitu apes videntur. Quapropter tinnitu æris, aut fictilis convocati eas in alveum ajunt./* But for any thing that I have observed, if it doe no hurt, it doth no good: and at the least they loose their labour that use it, you see them begin to fly aloft, which is a token that they would be gon, cast dust among them to make them come down. Not withstanding do what you can sometime they will away, and perhaps fly so far before they settle, that though you follow them never so fast, you must be content to leave them, happily to the happy finder. For when you have lost the sight & hearing of them, you have lost all right and property in them, *Examen ex alveo tuo evolaverit, eo usque intellegitur esse tuum, donec in conspestu quo est, nec difficilis persecutio ejus est: alioquin occupantis est. Justinian. l./* 2. *institutionum juris de re: divis./*

\31 *Some swarmes provide their houses aforehand/*/ Sometime they wil bee provided of a house before they swarme, which some harbingers have found, and viewed, and dressed against their comming: as either a holow tree, or a void hive: and then wil they away presently, and by no meanes settle til they come thither. \32 *and then they flie away directly to the place./*/ Unto which place they wil flie, not, as at other times, uncertainely this way and that way: but as directly as they can guesse. In so much that if a tree stand in their way, they wil nether take the one side nor the other, but passe straighte through him. A poore woman having taken [cw: a poore]

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

a poore swarme to keepe for halfe by neweyeerestide lost hir owne part and hir partners: and being carelesse of the hive when the Bees were dead, shee let it stand abroad til shee had forgotten it: the next sommer comming into hir garden, shee found some Bees passing to & fro hir hive, which were then busie in clensing and dressing it: she wisely fearing that the Bees came to cary away the wax that was leaft, bad hir daughter take the hive and carry it in: the wench following hir play did happyly forget hir mothers command: & by that meanes the hive stood stil, til the unexpected swarm came, that afterward stored hir garden. It is not amisse therfore to follow the councel of *Columella./* \33 *Vacua alvearia stet semper parata in apiario./*/ *Oportet autem vacua domicilia collocata in apiariis habere. Nam sunt nonnulla examina, quæ cum processerint, [+statim sedem sibi quærant] in proximo, eandenqe occupent quam vacuam repererint/*.
+Seu potius prius quæsitam, lustratam, & paratam ad eant. *v.n./*31.
\34 *The hiving of Bees./*/ When your swarme hath made choise of a lighting place, you shal quickly see it knit togither in forme (if nothing let) of a pomegranat, or cluster of grapes. Assoone as the better part is settled, or at least assone after as may be, hive them. \35 *When they are to be hived./*/ For the longer they hange the lother they are to be put from the place, the more time they loose from their worke, & the more in danger are they to bee gone. For when they are once [cw: setled] [F3]

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

setled, they presently send forth spies, to search out an abiding place: who if they returne with good news before swarming-time be past that day, they rise presently, & are gone: otherwise they will stay till swarming time the next daie. \36 *The token of their flying away after they bee setled./*/ But whensoever the spies have sped, they returne with al speed, & no sooner do they touch the pomgranate, but they begin to shake their wings like as the Bees doe that are chilled: which the next perceiving do the like: and so doth this soft shivering passe as a watch-worde from one to an other, untill it come to the inmost Bees wherby is caused a great hollownes in the pomgranat. When you see them do thus, then may you bid them farewel: for presentlie they begin to unknit, and to be gone. And then though you hive them never so wel, they wil not abide. 
\37 *How to fit the hives to the swarmes/*/ When you see your swarme, first make choice of a hive for it. If you would have it to cast the next yeere, you must take a hive proportionable to the bignes & time of the swarme. A swarme of the beginning of *Gemini/* put into a hive that conteineth thrise so much as the swarme is: A swarme from the beginning of *Cancer/* into a hive that conteineth twise so much: And others as they come later, so let the hives bee lesse in like proportion unto these: So that the Bees may fill their hive thay yeere, or at the least within a handful or a little more, which they may [cw: make]

===

$*and the hiving of them/*/$

make up the next yeere in good time. For they wil seldom swarme before the hive be full. For example: a swarme of a peck at the beginning of *Gemini/* should have a hive of three pecks: & such a one at the beginning of *Cancer/* shoulde have a hive of halfe a bushel. 
\38 *How to make your stalls great/*/ But if you desire to have great & faire stals, because little ones are not wel able to defend themselves against their enimies, namely weather, waspes, and robbers; then let your hives be of a bushel or thereabout, if the swarmes may at the least halfe fil them the first yeere: for then wil they thoroughly fil them the next, and perhaps swarme: & the third yeere if it be kind they wil not faile. But then are they to be kept warme the first winter, *v./* \*v.c./*3 *n./* 38./  Otherwise you maie put two good swarmes togither, *v./* \*v.n./*52./ and then they wil be able to keepe themselves warme. 
\39 *A Mantle a Rest and a Brush alwaies in a readines./*/ Your hive being fitted & dressed, you must have also in readines a Mantle, a Rest, and a brush. The Mantle may be a sheet or half-sheet, or some other linnen cloth an ell square at the least. The rest is a three-square sticke eighteen inches long, & three inches thicke. The Brush is a handful of benets, hysop, or other herbs, or boughs bound taper-wise togither. 
\40 *What the hives must doe./*/ Al things necessary thus prepared, let the hiver, which must weare no offensive apparel, *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*25./ first drinke of the best beere, and wet his hand and face therewith: and then let him go about [cw: his] [F4]

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

his busines soberly & gently taking good heed where he sets his foot & how he handleth them for if hee treade upon a Bee, or by any other meanes crush one of them; they presently finding it, by the ranke smel of the poisonous humor, wil be so angry; that he shal have work enough to defend him selfe, unlesse he have on his complet harnis, *v/* \*v.c./*1.*.n/*38./ and being thus disquieted they will be the worse to hive. 
\41 *The manner of hiving./*/ The manner of hiving is so manifold, by reason of the many and different circumstances of the lighting places, that it can hardly be taught by precepts; but is rather to be learned by use and experience, guided with reason and discretion. Neverthelesse for the helpe of novices, I wil set downe some particular instances, which may serve for discretion in al other. 
\42 *How to hive a swarme that lighteth upon a bough./*/ When your swarme lighteth upon a bough, if it bee within two foote of the ground, first spread your Mantle right under it, and laie the Rest upon the Mantle about a foot from the midle, toward that side which is from the winde, if the winde be rough: otherwise set it towarde the sun: for there must be their way in and out the hive. Then cut the bough (if you may conveniently) & lay it on the mantle along by the Rest, & set the hive over it, so that on side may stay upon the Rest and hang out over it some 3. inches. If there be any other boughes with bees besides, lay them upon the mantle by the [cw: hive] 

=== 

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

hive, which if you wag now and then a little they will make the more speed into the hive. Otherwise you may shake downe the Bees upon the mantle: and let the hive over them as before, and they wil presently up into the hive. Otherwise you may shake them into the hive, & set the hive upon the Mantle and Rest as before. And if any begin to knit againe upon the bough, cease not to shake it, or else, when they are knit, cut the bough, and lay it by the hive.
And if some of them bee fallen to the grounde, then placing the Rest as neere unto them as may be, set the hive over them as before without a mantle, and the rest of them having cut the bough or boughes lay beside the hive. 
\43 *How if it light upon a high bough./*/ If the bough be higher, cut it of likewise: and if some of the swarme chance to fal in the cutting, then hold the bough in the place, till they be settled againe, and so bring them downe in your hand or for more suretie let an other second you with the ready hive holding it directly under the swarme: them having first taken away al the twigs of the bough that may let you, cut of the bough or boughs (for sometime  they will hang upon two or three) & put them into the hive: & so bringing them down set the hive upon the Mantle and Rest, as before. But if the tree be very high, and you want a lader or other meanes to come down gent- [cw:ly]

===

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

ly with them in your hand; you may let them downe by a corde. Then shake them from the bough upon the Mantle, or into the hive, and do as before. 
\44 *How if it light upon a bough that cannot be cut./*/ If you cannot conveniently cut the bough, your next way is to shake the Bees into the hive, and, presently, covering the bottom with a cloth, so bring them downe: and then taking away the cloth set the hive upon the Mantle as before. But then you must looke that many will rise againe, and not easily forsake the place. For which cause you must not cease to trouble them by shaking the bough, wiping them of gently with your Brush, and laying on mugwort, marges, nettles, or other weedes, or hearbes, and by spitting and blowing upon the place: and after a while they will all to their fellows in the hive. 
\45 *How if it light upon the body of a tree./*/ If they light upon the body of a tree, or upon some great arme that will not be shaken, then set one side of the hive right over the Bees, & with the Brush drive them up by troubling still the lower and waiward part. But if you have no meanes to fasten the hive by tying it above, or propping it beneath with prongs or the like, then must you be faine to sweepe them into the hive with the Brush (not in any wise with a goose wing *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*23./as some use to doe) and then setting them on the Mantle and Rest under the tree trouble the place as before [cw: If] 

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

\46 *How if it light upon the top of any thing./*/ If they light on the top of any thing, as of a stub, pollard, or hedge; set one side of the hive over them propping the other side with a prong or two, and drive them up as before. 
\47 *How if it light in the middle of a dead hedge./*/ If they light in the middle of a dead hedg (unlesse you can, by removing some sticks, conveniently come at them to drive them in) you must violently knock the hedge on the other side, so forcing the Bees into the hive: and then setting them downe, trouble the place as before. But then be sure to be troubled your selfe: for it is hard to get them from such a hold. 
\48 *How if it light on some hollow side of a stub (shrub??) or tree/*/ If they light on some hollow side of a stub or tree, which they wil be loth to leave, beware in any case you wet them not, for that doth not only drowne many, but also maketh the rest more eagerly keep the place: because some through the wet cannot fly away, and their fellowes finding them there will still resort unto them. But when you have moved them by other meanes as much as you may, put some morter or cloome into the hollow place, moving it forward by little and little so that you burie none of the Bees, until you have spread it over the place: and then they will presently forsake that, and take some other part of the tree or stub, where you may more easily hive them. 
\49 *How if it flyinto a hollow tree/*/ When they fly into a hollow tree, so that by none of the foresaid meanes you can hive them, then must you remove them by some offen- [cw: sive]

=== 

$*Of the swarming of Bees/*/$

sive smoake, and make them chuse a new lighting place: which is thus to be done. If the Bees ly above the hoale they went in (as they will doe if they may) then boare a hoale above them: if beneath, beneath them: but be sure that the upper hole be wide enough, rather then fail make two or three with a two inch auger. Then file a piece of match, or for want of match, take a little hay, or other thing that will smoke moderately, and not flame; and put it into the tree beneath them: and you shall see them fly forth above for life, & presently settle in some place where you may hive them. But this is to bee done the same or the next day at the farthest: for afterward they will abide the smother, and rather loose their lives then leave their goods. 
\50 *The swarme is alwaies to be kept together lest the Bees kill one another./*/ But in all manner hivings this one rule is generall. The swarme must be continually kept together: for if at that time part remaine from the company but the space of half an houre or lesse, afterward when they find them, and would returne unto them, they are used as strangers and robbers: for as fast as they come they are beaten and killed: and those that escaping thence goe back to their old home, find no better entertainment: and those few that escape thence, desperately runne into any other hives, and so leape out of the frying pan into the fire [cw: And]

=== 

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

And therefore when the swarme is hived, if you see part begin to gather together by themselves, remove them as speedily as you can, that they may goe to their fellowes in time. 
\51. *The swarme to be set neer the lighting place./*/And alwaies set the hive as neere the lighting place as maybe: which if some inconvenience wil not suffer you to doe, yet set it within the length of a pearch, or at the least within sight & hearing: and then lest those which are least at the lighting place, by loosing their company a while, loose their lives also; first trouble them by the meanes mentioned. *n./*43. & then cause some of the hived parte to arise by shaking them of the bough, and by wiping them downe that are on the outside of the hive. Which, when they are up, will make such a noise, that their fellows may easily finde them. And if anie yet hankering behinde chance to be set upon when they come to the hive, be-sprinkle the mantle, the hive, & the Bees with a little strong drink, and you shal part the fray. 
And if any man marvaile why they of the same swarme shoulde so soone be strange one to another, seeing that Bees of one hive being pent a whole day in an other, are yet welcome to their fellowes at the last; I can give no other reason but this, that they knowing a swarme may part, & so each part become a several com- [cw:pa-]

pany, they deeme these to be such by their long absence. And if you aske why they shoulde finde so hard entertainment in their old home from whence they came, it is because they went away with a governour of their owne, and so became a several company. And therefore if she bide away, as many as come backe (unlesse they come presently) are used as strangers: but if part have brought hir home againe, the rest do safely returne afterward, either that evening, or the next morrow.
\52 *What to doe if a swarme part./*/ If the swarm part, as somtime it wil, & settle in divers places so neer that thet may see each other; let the greatest part alone, specially if it be best to hive, & trouble the other in the setling with shaking, gentle rubbing with weeds, and spitting & blowing in the place, that they may go to their fellowes. If they be setled & hand upon a bough, cut the bough and bring them to them. If they be settled in some other place, then put them in a hive without spleetes: and if they bee within a pearch of the other parte, move them both, one towardes an other by little and little they be close togither. After they have stoode so about halfe an howre, lift up the spleeted hive from his Mantle & Rest, and shake the bees out of the unspleeted hive upon the same: you may first knocke the hive downe right upon the mantle, & then presently clap it twise or thrise betweene your hands. [cw: This]

=== 

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

This done sprinkle both parts with good drink, and then without any stay set the spleeted hive over them and they wil straight way up into it. But lay the unspleeted hive along hard by, not where it stood, but on the other side: and those that remaine in it wil follow their fellows. But if the parts be farther a part then a pearch, then drive them togither the same night, *v.c./*10.*p./*1.*n/*17.beginning at *late in an evening/*, *&c./* unto *and forthwith carrie/*, & when by clapping of the stranger you have gotten as many Bees forth as you can, first pul out the little combe that they have made, putting it into the receiver: & then use the hive as the unspleeted hive.
\53 *When & how to put two swarmes togither./*/ In like manner when you have little swarms about a gawne or under, specially after *Cancer/*, put two or three of them togither, whether they rise in the same day, or in divers: (but then make that the reciever which was first hived.) For being thus united they wil labour cheerefully, gather store of wealth, and stoutly defend themselves against al enimies, whereas if they were kept a sunder, they would surely perish the next robbing-time, or winter, or hiving would doe you little good. And thus may you do to those that are good, if you desire to have them excellent good, *v/*, \*v.n./*38./ and therefore if two swarmes rising at the same time do weld & knit togither, (as lightly they wil doe, if they be within hearing one of another) never trouble your selfe [cw: to]

to part them, nor to be sorry for the chance. For those two being all one, are better then three such that are alone. Wherefore they are little acquainted with the nature of Bees that fetch their similitudes from them to crosse that rich, mighty, renowmed, thrice happy *Union./* In joining two swarmes togither use them as if they were two parts of one: And if they rise in divers daies, drive the later into the former. 
\54 *How to stay a swarme that is going home again./*/ When a swarme upon some dislike goeth home againe, if you perceive it before many be entred the hive, shut the dore: so will they settle upon the hive, where you may easilie hive them. For the swarmes that returne into the hive do sometime stay long before they rise againe, & when they rise, specially if they were hived, they are likewise to fly away: although I have knowne a swarme to rise fowre times in three daies, and at the last to be quietly hived. 
\55 *How to keep them from other hives when they ar going home/*/ If anie of them bee going into an other hive (as somtime, where the hives stand neere togither they wil do, because they cannot discerne their home for their fellowes that are so thicke before the dore) shut that hive, or stand before it: for as many as enter will die, or scape narrowly.
\56 *What to doe when the swarme is new-hived/*/ When your Bees are hived, those that hang on the outside drive in gentlie with your brush: and lay the corners of the Mantle, that are farthest from the Rest, over the hive, with boughs [cw: also]

===

$*and the hiving of them./*/$

also to shadow it, if the weather be hot. But if you find them unwilling to goe in (as in extreame hot weather they wilbe, though they like the hive wel enough) then strive not with them, but laying the corners of the Mantle over the hive, as before, with boughs to shade it, there suffer them til the heat be abated, and then drive them in: and if you thinke they cannot otherwise wel endure the heate, cover the hive againe with Mantle and boughs. And so let it stand til it wax dark, and all the Bees be come home. 
\57 *How to remove it in the evening./*/ Then knitting the foure corners of the Mantle together, at the top of the hive, and binding the Mantle about close to the middle of the hive with a smale line, cary the swarme to his place. \58 *How to set it on his seat./*/ And after a while, taking away the Mantle, set it upon his seate with the dore toward the South or rather Southwest: *v./* \*V.c./*2.*n/*.15./ and leaving only a breathing place, for feare of stifling them if the hive be close, then cloome it up close, and put on a hacle *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*13.*&/*19./ and so let it stand til it bee faire and warme the next day. For if the hive be least open, in the morning betimes they wil resort to their former standing and there abide, sometime flying about, somtime settling on the ground: where if the cold or wet take them many dy. \59 *How to use it in the morning/*/ When you see the weather fit them, then hanging the Mantle, or other whit cloth upon the hive, let them go: & at night take away your Mantle [cw: againe.] [G]

againe. 
\60 *A swarme lighting neer his seat is presently to be set thereon/*/ If the swarme light in your garden within a perch of the seate that is appointed for him, it is best to set it there at the first. So will not the Bees loose any time the next day in haunting an other place, as knowing their home: and therefore need no white cloath over them for their direction, nor to be shut in the morning as other swarmes. 
All swarmes, if the morrow be faire, will desire to be abroad betimes, and knowing their want, wil bestirre themselves more lustily in their labour then other Bees. 
\61 *Foul wether the first day doth much discourage a swarme./*/ But if the fowle weather keepe them in the first day, then are they much discouraged: the next day being indifferent, when other Bees worke hard, they will scarce looke out of the dore, not daring to commit their leene & thin bodies to the cold aire. And if they be shut in the second day also, then will they not wagge (though they dy for it) untill the weather bee very pleasant. \62 *A swarme may live 5 daies without hony./*/ They may live five daies in the hive without hony: but afterward they begin to string downe hanging at one anothers heels. *Pedibus connexæ ad limina pendent./* Which is a certaine signe of death, if they be not presently relieved with hony and faire weather.

##CHAP. 6/##

\1 *Bees most industrious creatures./*/
{U}Nto the industrious nature of Bees nothing is more odious then sloth and idleness: while there is matter to worke upon, unles they be let by unkinde weather, their labour never ceaseth: yea the old Bees, which have spent their daies in continual labour, wil not at the last alow themselves any immunity or rest in their hives, as a recompence for their paines past, but continue stil their travaile unto death, *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*54./
\2 *In three months they cannot work/*/ In the three dead months indeed, *Sagit. Capric./* & *Aquar./* because then there is nothing to gather, they worke not, (yet when a faire daie or howre commeth they fly abroad to play & recreat themselves: *v/*) \*v.c./*1 *n/*55/ but so long as any good flowers grow, even from *Pisces/*, or a litle before unto *Sagit./* \3. *All the yeere after they loose no time/*/ and some yeeres somewhat after, which is full nine months, they loose no time. *Nullus, dum per cælum licuit, perit dies./* \Nat: hist, l.11 c.6./ But follow their sweet work tooth and naile.

\4 *How they gather wax./*/ Their work consisteth in making either wax or hony. The wax they gather with their fangs: which being kept soft with the heate of their little bodies, of the aire, and of their hives is easily wrought into combs. This work is so nimbly and closely done, that it can hardly be perceived: insomuch that *Aristotle/* plainly confesseth. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Nec vero quemadmodum operantur visum ad huc est/* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.16/ But *Plinie/* willing to goe a little beyond him telleth us a tale of a lanthorne hive made at Rome, through which forsooth their doings in the hive were discried, & in another place of another like devise. \Nat.hist.lib.31.c.14/ *Multi alvearia speculari lapide fecere, ut operantes intus spectarent./* But unlesse the Bees also were transparent as well as the hive, this cannot be: seeing they do alwaies frequently compasse the combes round about. A more likely way then that were to have a moveable piece in one side of the hive, which when you have taken away, you may see the drones and the hony-bees walking together to and fro, and with their doubled heat hatching their yong, but their worke can you not see: [cw: though]

===

$*and labour./*/$

though you remove and part the Bees til the bare combes appeare. \5 *How you may see the working of the combs./*/ But if your curiositie would so faine behold the maner of their curious & artificiall building, the only way is this. In *Gemini/* set up a last yeeres midling swarme two or three handfulls above the stoole: & then when most of the Bees are abroad, but most fitly in the forenoone when they are most quiet, you may behind the stole behold them working on the edges of their combes, and having blowne their liquid and soft wax out of their mouths (as the waspes doe their drossie stuffe, which you may see them gather from pales with their fanges and so carrie it away) to fasten and fashion it with their fanges and forefeet.
\6.*How much they bring at once/*/ How much wax they bring at once, doth appeare by the new swarmes whose first weekes worke is spent chiefly in building combes: wherein they are so earnest, that it falleth out with them as it is in the proverbe, *The more hast the work speede./* For many of their burdens do fall from them before they can fasten them to the combes. You may then see great store of them upon the stoole by the skirts of the hive, like unto the white scales which fal from yong birds feathers. And therefore some have imagined, that they also are scales, which the yong Bees doe likewise shed from their wings. But put you some of those parcells together with warme fingers, and you will quickly be resol- [cw: ved] [G3]

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

ved of that doubt. 
\7 *The fashion of their combs and celles./*/ The Bees combes are placed otherwise then the waspes: for the waspes hang theirs one over another, and the Bees their one by an other. Beginning them in the top of the hive, at that distance that a Bee may reach from one to another. 
Their cells or little hoals are made six square according to the number of their feet: and of that length and widenesse, that each of them may easily conteine a Bee. Which are so artificially wrought and joined together, that S. *Ambrose/* in the consideration thereof saith. \Hexamer.l.5.c.21./ *Qua castra quadrata tantum, possunt habere artis & gratiæ, quantum habent crates favorum, in quibus minutæ ac rotundæ cellulæ connexione sui invincem ful ciuntur? Quis enim architectus eas docuit hexagoniailla cellarum indiscreta laterum æqualitate componere, ac tenues inter domorum septa ceras suspendere, stipare mella, intexta floribus horrea nectare quodam distendere?/*
The use of these cells is to lay up their hony in, and to breed their Nymphs. 
\8 *The drone-combe./*/ Besides these ordinary combes there is commonly one drone-comb in a hive, wherein the Cephens are bred, made for the nonce with wider celles. \His.l.9.c.40/ *Sunt loculi ipsi sucorum ampliores, & finguntur seor sim quoq, per se favi fucorii./* Although in some hives the neather parts of the drone-combes be made out with Nymph-celles. The [cw: drone] 

===

$*and labour./*/$

drone-combe being no thicker then others, & yet the drones longer then the smale Bees, they increase the length of his cels by covering them not with a flat cover, as they do the rest, but with a deepe holloe one like an old wives thrumbed cap: which afterward, when the drons are bred, they take away. And when those cels are void of Cephens, they fill them as they doe the other with hony; yea and after swarming-time, if they want upper celles for their hony, they wil not tarry til they come forth themselves, but liking better their roome then their company, they draw them out of their seminaries before they be ripe. 
\9 *The queenes cels are built single in divers places./*/ But the queenes celles are built single, every one by himselfe, and that in divers places of the hive, some above, and some beneath: that, as other princes, shee may for hir delight remove at hir pleasure: but for the most part in the outsides of the combes: for although it be fit for princes to be neere their chiefe cities, yet doe they not love to bee pestered in the midst of them. \10 *In fashion a round/*/ In fashion they are round, which is the most perfect figure, as the six square is most fit for comely joining many such buildings together. They are also larger then the rest, to shew that subjects houses should not match their soveraignes in greatnesse. In these pallaces doe they breed their yong princes, *v./* \*v.c./*4.*n./*15/ \Nat.hist.l.II.c.II./ *Plinie/* speaketh thus of them. *Regias imperatoribus extruunt/* [cw: *amplas./*] [G4]

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

*amplas, magnificas, separatas, tuberculo eminentes./*
\11 *The common error anent these celles./*/ The common people finding them alwaies in those stalls that die, take them for certain signs of death, and cal them pipes forsooth, or taps: and therefore when they see them in a stal that they take, they say this was taken in good time for it is piped, and therefore would have stood no longer. But seeing none are without, no not the yongest swarmes, ordinary reason might teach them to forgo that fond conceipt.
\12 *The combes have 3 colours successively./*/ The combs at the first are white, which they cal Virgin-wax: after the first summer they turne yelow: and in the end, when they wax old and begin to corrupt, they change againe to a blackish & durty colour. \13 *Wax is gathered only in 4 months./*/ The time when they gather wax is only betweene *Taurus/* and *Virgo/*: unlesse *Aries/* bee warme and kinde, for then they may begin in that month. 
\14 *Hony in 9/*/ But hony they gather al the yeere, save only in those 3 dead months, when the weather keepeth in both Bees and flowers. \15 *The Bees gather 2 sorts of hony./*/ And it is of two sortes: the one pure and liquid which is called *Nectar/*, the other grosse and solid, which we may like by reason tearme *Ambrosia./* For both serve for the foode of these divine creatures. 
\16 *How ambrosia or grosse hony is gathered./*/ The grosse hony is gathered by their fanges: from whence is it conveied by the fore legs to the thighes of the hin-legs (*Quæ flores comportant prioribus pedibus fœmina onerant propter id natura scabra, pedes priores rostro:toteq onustærement far/* [cw: *cina/*]

===

$*and labour./*/$

*cina pandatæ/*) and so nimbly, that unlesse you have a quicke eie, you can scarce perceive it. 
This worke may best be seene in the spring, when they gather upon the blackthorne: for then by reason of the cold they are not so quicke.
\17 *Ambrosia some serveth to feed the scadons: some is wrought with nectar and laid up in store./*/ In sommer, when they have brought these burdens home, some unload them into the dry cells for their yong to feed on, which are not yet able to fly abroad: others worke them with the *Nectar/*, which being of it selfe cleere and thin, is thereby made thicke and yelow. And in the beginning & ending of the yeere, look what they save when the wether is faire, they lay up for themselves against a rainy day. Which while it is good they wil feed on, to save their old store as much as may bee. \18 *Ambrosia alone is soone corrupted./*/ But this kind of hony is like unto fresh fish: it must not long be kept. For if, being laide up in the cels, by reason of plenty that comes in fresh and fresh it ly unspent: after a while it corrupteth, and of sweet becommeth the sowrest and the most unsavory of al things both to the tast and smell, which then they commonly cal stopping. \20 *Much stopping maketh the Bees forsake their hives./*/ Where there is any store of this stuffe, it doth so offende the Bees, that oft times it maketh them to forsake all. Most of them wil that yeere goe foorth in swarmes: and those few that are least wil never prosper, *v./* \*v.c./*3.*n./*43./
Anent this leg-stuffe or grosse hony there is [cw: a]

===

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

\21 *This ambrosia is commonly taken for wax./*/ a general error. For without al scruple or doubt men do count it & cal it wax (as did some also in time of olde, whose opinion *Aristotle/* doth thus deliver. \His.l.9.40./ *Ceram apes perreptando flores capiunt priorum acumine piæum: mox priores in medios abstergunt, & medios in blæsa posteriorum./*) But against (as I shal shew you) both sense and reason. 
\22. *Which error is disproved by sense./*/ If you put it to your tongue, it hath the taste of hony, which wax hath not. If you feele it betweene your warme fingers, it muttereth apart, where wax sticketh fast togither. If you put it to the fire, it melteth not, as waxe doth. And whereas wax is al of one colour, that is white at the first, *v./* \*v.n./*12./ even as those little fallings of the new swarmes, (which is wax indeede) this leg-honie is of divers colours, white, black, yelow, green, red, tawny, oringe, murry, and of sundry midling colours. Therefore sense doth say it is no waxe. 
\23 *And reason./*/ The reasons are two. The first is because when they gather abundance of this stuffe, they have never the more wax. The other because when they make most waxe, they gather none of this. 
For proofe of the first, All Bees betweene *Virgo/* and *Taurus/* do gather abundance of it: & yet are not in their combes in this time any whit enlarged. Also one of those old stals that are ful of combes, doth carrie more of this matter al the sommer long then many swarmes & yet [cw: have]

===

$*and labour./*/$

have they no more wax at the end of the yeere then at the beginning.
For proofe of the other, The new swarmes within one weeke, if the wether serve them, wil have halfe filled their hives with combs: & yet in al this space shal you scearce see one carry anie of this. If you would knowe the reason why the stockes gather so much, & the new swrmes so little; it is because the stockes have *schadons/* which they feed with part, & the new swarmes have none: but the more part the stockes doe mingle and worke with *Nectar/*: whereas the swarmes at first do lay up pure *Nectar/* onlie, *v./* \*v.n./*26/ And if anie foolish Bee do carry in *Ambrosia,/* it is put a dry cell where it turneth to stopping, *v./* \*v.n./*19.24 *And by authoritie/*/ as I have seene within a fortnight after the hiving. 
And this though now it seeme new, yet was it knowne many ages agoe. *Plinie/* writeth of it thus. \Nat.hist.l.II.c.7./ *Præter hæc/* (I.*præter ceram & nectar/*) *convehitur erithace, quam aliqui sandaracham, alii cerint hum vocant. Hic erit apum dum operantur cibus: qui sæpe invenitur in favorum inanitatibus sepositus; & ipse amari saporis./* Speaking in the last words of that which is corrupted. And before him *Aristot./* himselfe thus. \His.l.9.c.40/ *Mell apibus tum estate tum hyeme cibo est: sed recondunt alterum quoq cibarii genus, cui durities ceræ proxima quod sandaracham non nulli appellant./*

$*Of the Bees worke/*/$

\25 *How the pure nectar is gathered./*/ with their tongues, whence they let it downe into their bottels, which are within them like unto bladers: each of them wil hold a drop at once. You may see their little bellies strut with all. Men thinke because they see nothing on their legs, that they come in leere: when they are better and more heavily laden then the other. These bottles, assone as they come home they emptie into their combes. \Hist.an.li.c.22/ *Mel ore evomant in cellas./* \26 *At the first the Bees lay up meere nectars: afterward they mix it with ambrosia./*/ The swarmes beginning at the tops of the hives do lay up cleere *Nectar/* onlie, that it may last many yeeres if they can spare it: afterward they worke *Ambrosia/* and *Nectar/* together. And this is the cause why the hony is the upper part of the combes differeth from the rest which is alwaies yelow and soft; wheras that is cleere as crystal at the first, and liquid as water: and when it is two or three yeeres old becommeth white and hard. *Concresit autem mel concoctum iam tempore : initio enim ut aqua dilutum est, & primis diebus sine crassitudine cervitur./* \Hist.an.l.5.c.22/
\27 *Nectar of two sorts./*/
So that the *Nectar/* or liquid hony is of two sorts: one hard and white even like unto sugar, which is therfore called stone-hony, or corne-hony: the other so soft that it will runne, which therfore is called live-hony. \28 *Live-hony of two sortes/*/ And the live-hony is likewise of 2. sorts that which is cleere & crystalline gathered of a swarme, and taken the just yeere they cal virgin-hony, \*Virgin-hony/*/ which it is there- [cw:fore]

fore the purer because the cels are pure: the other which is yelow & thicker as being mixed with *Ambrosia/* (and therefore in the clarifying yeeldeth more skum) is called second honie. \*Second hony./*/ The virgin hony by standing turneth yelow: but it wil be a bright and pure yelow, whereas the other is darke and duskie: except in plentiful yeeres of *Nectar/*: for then the first shoot, *v./* if it be wel handled, wilbe litle inferiour to Virgin-hony. \*V.c./*10.p.2.*n./*2./
\29 *The full cels they close with waxe./*/ When the cels are full, they close them up with little filmes of wzxe, which they wil not breake untill winter and hunger drive them to it. And thus do they al the sommer, descending lower and lower from one cel to an other, until *Virgo/*: after which time they lay up no more in store. \30 *After Leo they lay up no hony/*/ For hony then waxeth scarce abroad, & thence-forth they can gather no more wax to shut it in. As for that which they purchase by fight & foraging, it doth them litle good. For the most part of it they presently spend & if they save any, they halfe fil a few cels with it, which being uncovered, ether themselves or some other theeves quickely devour, according to the proverbe, *Evill gotten goods are scone spent/*.

in great abundance: as apple, crab barbery, beech crowpickes, charlocke, rosemary, &c. But speciallie the plentifull Vetch, and Maple. They gather on the flower of the maple a whole month together, and somewhat on the flower of the vetch when his time is *v./* \*v.n./* 37./ but the greatest store of hony is drawn out of the black spot of the litle picked leafe of the vetch, which groweth on each side the two or three upper-most joints.

While the honi-dew lasteth, they are exceeding earnest plying their busines like men in harvest: you may see them so thick at the hives dore passing to and fro, that oftentimes they throw downe one an other for hast.

$*and labour./*/$

*sive purgantis se aeris succus./* But if conjectures might be admitted. I would rather judge it to be the very quintessence of all the sweetnesse of the earth (which at that time is most plentiful) drawne up, as other dewes, in vapours into the third region of the aire by the exceeding and continuall heate of the sun: and there concret and condensated by the nightly cold into this most sweete and soveraigne *nectar:/* and then doth it descend unto the earth in a dew or smale drizling raine: that he might wel say, *Constat materiam, ex qua melgignitur, rori esse congenerem./* \Gal. de aliment. l.3/ Which opinion is the more probable, because that when the yeere us backward in his fruites, the honi-dewes are also backward, comming only at such time as the fruits have the most solid and best juyce. Before, when the juyce is weake and watrish, and afterwarde, when it is dried and wasted, they are not. And this is the reason that in more hot & southernly climats, where the fruites are more forward, the hony-dews are more timely: as in *Italy/* before \Nat hist lib II.c.12/ *Gemini, Non omnino/*, saith *Plinie, priis vergiliarum exortu/*: *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n/*22/ whereas with us they fal not usually before *Cancer/*.
\41 *When the honydews are most frequent/*/ The hoter and drier the sommer is, the greater and more frequent are the hony-dews: & as they are caused through heat, so are they at the last dissolved by cold: but much raine at any time, as comming from a higher region wa- [cw:sheth] [H]

sheth away that which is already elevated: so that there can be no more untill an other fit of hot and dry weather. 
\42 *The time when they fall./*/ The time in which these hony-dewes fall is usually betweene the first and last daies of this month: although the continuance of hote & dry weather may cause them come som what rather, or last somwhat longer, even until mid. *Leo/* or after. They may happen at any time of the day: but for the most part in the morning before it be light, *Sub lucanis temporibus, Itaq tu prima aurora folia arborum melle roscida inventiuntur./*\Nat.hist.li.II.c.12./ And then shall you have the Bees up in a morning assone as they can see, making such a shril noise where they go, that a man may here them father then he can see them.

the rich spotted leafe of the same, before they have beene at home. Although when they come to a flowre that yeeldeth both *Nectar/* & *Ambrosia/*, they wil use somtime the tongue, & somtime the fanges, and gather them both. 
\48 *They gather hony out of poison./*/ But this may seeme more strange and wonderful, that out of the most stinking and poysonful weeds, as redweed, marges, henbane, & the like, they gather most sweet and holesome hony: and yet regard not the best and sweetest hearbs and flowers, as the rose, the prim-rose, clove-giliflowers, lavender, &c. wheat, barlie, pease, and such like.
\49 *What store of hony a stal may have./*/ What store of wax and hony a stall may gather, is uncertaine, some having more, some lesse, according to the number of the Bees, the greatnes of the hive, & the plentifulnes of the yeeres. With us it is counted a good stall that yeeldeth two or three gawnes of poulse: although in a tree there have beene found more then 7. or 8. But in other northerne countries we read of farre greater quantities. \Nat.hist. li.II.c.14/ *Plinie/* affirmeth that there was seene in *Germany/* a hony-comb 8. foot long. And *Paulus Jovius/* that in *Moscovia/* there are found in the woods & wildernesses great lakes of hony, which the Bees have forsaken, in the holow truncks of marvelous huge trees. \De legatione Moscovitarum, & Munsterus de Moscovia./ In so much that hony & waxe are the most certaine commidities of that country. Where, by that occasion, he setteth down [cw: this] [H2]

this story reported by *Demetrius/* a *Moscovite/* ambassador sent to Rome. A neighbour of mine (saith he) searching in the woods for hony slipt downe into a great holow tree, and there sunk into a lake of hony up to the brest: where when he had stucke fast two daies calling and crying out in vaine for helpe, because no bodie in the meane while came nigh that solitary place: at length when he was out of all hope of life, hee was strangly delivered by the meanes of a great beare: which comming thither about the same businesse that he did, and smelling the hony stirred with his striving, clambered up to the top of the tree, & thence began to let himselfe downe backward into it. The man bethinking himselfe, and knowing the worst was but death, which in that place he was sure of, beclipt the beare fast with both his hands about the loines, and whithall made an outcry as lowd as he could. The beare being thus sodainely affrighted, what with the handling, & what with the noise, made up again withal speed possible: the man held, & the bear pulled, until with main force he had drawne *Dun out of the mire/*: & then, being let go, away he trots *more afeard then hurt,/* leaving the smeared swaine in a joyful feare. 
\50 *Bees have necessary use of water/*/ The Bees earnest and hot labour, and the drought of the aire, togither with their cholerike complexion, which their very colour bewraieth, doth cause them much to desire cold [cw: water]

water. \51 *Chiefly for their breed/*/ Some thinke it serveth chiefly to feede their schadons. *Aquam tum portant, cum prolem nutriunt/*: \Hist. an.l.9.c.40./ and that not without reason, seeing that *Ambrosia/* their daily food is hot and drie: and indeed when the drones are done away, and breeding is ended, the Bees are nothing so frequent at the watring-places. But *Columella/* thinketh the use thereof to be more general, \De re rust. l.9.c.5./ *sine qua neq, favi, neq, mella, nec pulli deniq figurari queunt./*
\52 *The making of the watering place/*./ The watring-place should+ not be far from your garden, in the next side of a ponde or brooke made shelving not steepe in maner of a foord, and defended from beasts, geese, ducks, and such like. 
\Virg.Geor/ 
\53 *How to find wild Bees./*/ +For they wil never go far for water, if any be to be had neere hand *Sub mænibus urbis aquantur./* And therefore when you see Bees watring in woods, or other places not neere any hives, be sure those are wilde Bees, which are not farre from their neast. Watch them therefore which way they flie for they wil thence directly to it. Which if it be not within view, take a reede or kex, or some like holow thing open at one end, with a chinke cut in the other to let in light: and taking up a Bee by the wings put her into the cane, & shut her in with your thumbe: while shee goeth downe to the light, put in an other, and so as many as you thinke good. And then where you last see the Bees flying homward from the water, go to that place, and there let out one of the Bees in the box: which, when shee hath cast a ring to know where shee is, wil fly as directly home as the other: likewise where you see her last, let out an other and so the rest, until they have brought you to the stalle.

Left the Bees flying over the water unto it be throwne downe by tempestuous windes, & so drowned: for which cause it is good to lay lugs overthurt the water & other stales, that recovering them they may drie themselves againe, and so escape. 
\Virg. Geor./ *In medium seu stabis iners, seu profuet humor,
Transversas salices & grandia coniice saxa.
Pontibus ut crebris possint consistere, & alas
Pandere ad æstiniuum solem, si forte morantes
Sparserit, aut præcerps Neptuno immerserit Eurus./*
That they may safely settle upon it, and that it maie alwaies be kept moist by the neerenes of the water. For they choose rather to draw their drink out of moist earth then from the water it selfe, though it never be so clear: peradventure that the earth having received his earthynes, which before was insensibly mixte with the water, their triple searching tongue might the better trie out the pure element of water. 
Which otherwise wilbe the death of manhy for they are so earnest in their businesse, that though you offer to tread upon them, they will not move. 
\54 *The fashion of a watring trough/*/ For want of such a watring-place make a shelving trough, and set it in your garden the space of a pearch or two from the stals. And having filled it with water, lay a piece of a thinne bord or lath in the middle of it upon the water, to save them from drowning, if any happen to fal in. When the trough is old & the sides earthy they like it best. 
Of a planke or other piece of timber 3. foot long, 13. inches broad, and 3. inches thicke you may make a double trough with a partition. The length of the concavities let be two foote, the breadth of each 4 inches, the depth at the par- [tition]

$*and labour./*/$

tition 2. inches, from whence each bottom must ascend shelving by little and litle unto the outsides. So that there may be least uncut at each end six inches, at each side 2. inches, and in the middle for the partition one. 
If you have no such certaine watring-place, they must spend more time in seeking farther: & in rainy wether they wil ly about the neer plashes & puddles in the streets, where they are ofttimes trod under feet of men and beasts. 
\55 *After a showre they water at home/*/ After a showre they water for the most part in your garden upon the bare earth, the grasse, and wheresoever they finde it wet from above. In the chiefe breeding months *Aries/* and *Taurus,/* when the colde raine or winde hath kept them in some part of the day, they wil lie soe thick upon the grounde, if you have any store, that you can scarce tread beside them. At such time therefore let no heedles stranger come among them.
