#THE PREFACE/#  

##*to the Reader./*/##  

{T}He great naturalist, to expresse the excellencie of the nature of Bees, saith thus, *Inter omnia insecta principatus apibus et jure præcipua admiratio; solis ex eo genere hominum causam genitis/*. Of all *insecta/* the Bees are chiefe, and worthily to bee most admired; beeing the only thinges of that kinde, which are bred for the behoofe of men. The later part of which saying although the delicat Silk-worme have else-where disproved, and is now setting foot in this land, here also to except against it; yet must shee needs confesse the former, and, when shee is come, yeelde the precedence to the laborious Bee, as to hir elder sister; which as in time, so in vertue is before her. For the fruite of the Silke-worme serveth onlie to cover the bodie; but the fruite of the Bee to nourish and cure it: that is to bee applied outwardly, this to be inwardly received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health & necessitie. But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bees is so great and won-

derful, so comely for order and beauty, so excellent for art and wisdome, and so full of pleasure and profit; that the contemplation thereof may well beseeme an ingenious nature. And therefore not without cause are the Bees called the Muses birds.\*Var.l.3.ca.16./*/
The love of which did so ravish *Aristomachus/* and *Philiseus/*, that, as *Plinie/* reporteth,\*Nat hist.li.II./*/ they were pleased to spend most of their time in this pleasing busines. *Nequis/* (saith hee) *miretur amore carum captos Aristomachum Solensem duodesexaginta annis nihil aliud egisse; Philiscum vero Thasium in desertis apes colentem Agrium cognomimatum: qui ambo scripsere de his/*. *Aristotle/* thought his *Historia animalium/* unperfect, unles he had inserted a tract of the nature of Bees: of which hee discourseth more at large, then he doth of any other living creature. *Plinie/* likewise in his *Naturalis historia/* is very copious in this argument. Besides whom, divers other haue written therof: as *Columella, Varro, Palladius, Averroes/*. Yea the learned and grave fathers of the Church *S. Ambrose/* and *Isidore/* have thought it a subject fit for their pens. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later times both in Latine & English; which haue written many things of these admirable creatures. 
But in al their writings they seeme unto me to say little out of experience, and to rely more upon the relation of others; then anie certaine

knowledge of their owne. Notwithstanding in some of them, specially in *Aristotle & Plinie/*, are scatered many true and good observations; which, being found agreeable to experience, I have here and there, as occasion required, for authority and ornament interlaced. But the later writers, imitating the ancient where they thought good, choosing some of their directions and refusing others, doe, for the most part, unluckely light upon the worse: so that being compared, they are no way matchable unto them; whome by the advantage of time they might haue surpassed. Among which *Georgius Pictorius/* a learned Physitian deserveth best, as having taken most paines in perusing the ancient authors, and gathering their matter into his methode. Whom one *T. H./* of London translating word for word into English as wel as he could, concealing the authors name, adventured to publish in his owne name. These and the like when a scholar hath thoroughly read, he thinketh himselfe throughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth abroad to put his skil in practise, every silie woman is ready to deride his learned ignorance. 
Wherefore considering howe greate the vertue and efficacy of the fruite of these \v.c.10.p.3/ creatures is, both for the preserving, and restoring of mans health, I thought it not amisse to spend some by-time for my recreation, in sear-[cw:ching]

ching out the nature & properties of Bees, that I might know how to do good unto them, which are so good for us, and what is the due & righte ordering of these delightful, profitable, and necessary creatures. And having to my contentment, though to my cost, in some sort attained my desire, I was incited, even by the rule of charity, to communicate that to my neighbours & countrymen, which I haue found so beneficiall to my selfe: so that the reader may now freely reape the fruite of that, which the author hath deerly sowen vnto him.
\*De generat.an.l.3.c.10/*/ The Philosopher intreating of the breeding of Bees, professeth himselfe uncertaime of their sex: and therefore, willing in this uncertainty to grace so worthy a creature with the worthier title, he every where calleth their governor *βασιλεύς/*, or *Rex/*. As many as followed him, searching no farther then he did, were contente to say as he said. So that I am enforced (unlesse I wil choose rather to offend in *rebus/* then in *vocibus/*) by their leave and thine (learned reader) to straine the common signification of the word *Rex/*, and, in such places, to translate it *Queene/*, sith the males heer beare no sway at al, this being an *Amazonian or Feminine kingdome. v./* \*V.c.4.n.20.&22./*/
In distinguishing the times of the yeer, I use the Astronomical months as most natural and fitting to my purpose; beginning each month with the day that the sun entreth into his sign,

$*to the Reader./*/$ 

& giuing the name of each signe to his month; because the most notable thinges concerning Bees, which are to be observed in them or to be done for them fal out in the beginnings of these months. Where note that by the name of each month, is commonly understood the first day of the same month (namely wheresovever this preposition *at/* is set before it) except only where it followeth the preposition *in/* or *after/*, or otherwise the sense doth plainely shew that it is spoken of the whole month. 
I am out of doubt that this book of *Bees/* wil in his infancy be hidden in obscurity as the book of *tropes and figures/* did for a while go unregarded, without friends or acquaintance: But as that did by litle & litle insinuat it selfe into the love & liking of many schooles, yea of the Vniversity it selfe, where it hath been both privatly and publikley read (a favour which this mother doth seldome afford to hir owne children, least happily shee should seeme too fond over them) so this will in time travaile into the most remote partes of this great kingdome of greate *Britaine/*, and be entertained of al sorts both learned and unlearned: although the *Muses/* birdes are fittest for the *Muses/*, & the knowledge of their long-hidden secrets was cheifly published for the *Muses friends/*. *Quibus me, quic quid sum, & studia mea dico. Wotton. Jul. II. 1609./*

#A TREATISE CONCER-

##*Of the nature and properties of Bees, and of their Queene./*
CHAP. I./##

{A}Mong all the creatures which our bountifull GOD hath made for the use and service of man, in respect of (I) great profit with small cost (2) of their ubiquity or beeing in al countries, and (3) of their continual labour and consenting order, the Bees are most to be admired. \*1. Bees yeelde great profit with smal cost/*/ For first with the provision of a hive and some little care and attendance, which need be no hinderance to other busines, but rather a delightful recreation amid the same, they bring in store of sweete delicates most holesome both for meate and medicine, \Ambrosius Hex.amer.l.5.cap.21./ *Fructum apum ab omnibus desideratur, & quæritur: nec pro personarum diversitate discernitur, sed indiscreta sui gratia regibus pariter ac mediocribus aquali suavitate dulcescit: nec solum voluptati, sed etiam/* [cw:salu-]

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$
\Pli nat.hist I.ii.c.5/ *salutiest./* And another saith, *Mille ad usus vitæ laborem tolerant & opera conficiunt/* : as they wel know who know the rare vertues of hony and waxe: a taste whereof I wil give you in the last chapter. \*2 Every country for for bees./*/ Secondly whereas *non omnis fert omnia tellus,/* some country yeeldeth one fruit, some another, some beareth one graine, some an other some breedeth one kind of cattle, some an other: there is no ground of what nature soever it be, whether it be hot or colde, wet or drie, hil or dale, woodland or champian, meddow, pasture, or arable: in a word whether it be battle or barren, which yeeldeth not matter for the Bee to work upon. \*3 Bees abhorre idlenesse./*/ And thirdly in their labor and order at home and abroad they are so admirable, that they may be a patterne unto men both of the one and of the other. For unlesse they be let by wether, weaknes, or want of matter to worke on, their labour never ceaseth. \Plin. nat. hist.l.ii.c.5/ In admiration whereof one saith,  *Quos efficacia industriæque, tantæ comparemus nervos? quai vires? quos ratione medius fidius viros?/* \*4 Bees have a commonwealth/*/ & for their order it is such that they may wel be said to have a common wealth, since all that they do is in common without any privat respect. \Nat hist III.31.c.5/ *Nihil norunt nisi commune:/* They work for al, they watch for al, they fight for al. \5 *Their working, watching, fighting, dwelling, diet, wealth and young ones are all in common./*/ In their private quarrels when they are from the hive or common treasury, howsoever you use them they wil not resist, if by any meanes they can get away. *Cum ruri sint, nec sibi/* 
[cw: *invicem/*] 

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

\Arist.hist.anim.lib.9.cap.40/ *invicem, nec ullis aliis nocent; at vero apud suos al veos pugnant accrimè/*: their dwelling and diet are common to al alike: they have like common care both of their wealth and young ones.
\Ambr.Hex.lib.5.ca.21/ *Solæ in omni genere animantium communem omnibus sobolem habent, unam omnes incolunt mansionem, unius patriæ clauduntur limine, in commune omnibus labor, communis cibus, communis operatio, communis usus, & fructus est./* \6 Bees alwaies loial to their soveraigne./ And al this under the government of one Monarch, of whom above all things they have a principal care & respect, loving, reverencing, and obeying her in al things. 
\Virg Geor/ *Præterea regem non sic Ægyptus & ingens
Lydia, nec populi Parthorum aut Medus Hydaspes 
Observant: rege incolumi mens omnibus una est:
Amisso rupere fidem: contructaque una est:

Ille operum custos, illum admirantur: & omnes

Et sæpe attollunt humeris, & corpora bello

If she goe forth to solace her selfe (as sometime she will) many of them attend upon her, garding her person before and behind; they which come forth before her ever now & then returning, and looking back, and making withall an extraordinarie noise, as if they spake the language of the knight Marshalls men, & so away they fly together, & anon in like man-

ner they attend her back againe. This I may say because I have seene it: although the Philosopher be of another mind *Reges/*, saith hee, *nunquam foris visuntur, niscum migratur./* \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40/ If by hir voice she bid them goe, they swarme; if being abroad she dislike the weather, or lighting place, they quickly returne home againe; while she cheereth them to battaile they fight *v/*, \Vid.c.7.n.32./ when she is silent they cease, while she is well, they are cheerefull about their worke, if she droope, they faint also: if she dy, they will never after prosper, but thenceforth languish till they bee dead too. *Rege mortuo mæret plebs ignava, non cibos convebit, non procedit, tristi tantum murmure glomeratur circa corpus eius./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.i7/ \7 Bees endure no government, but a Monarchie/But if they have many Princes, as when two fly away with one swarme, or when two swarmes are hived to gether; they strike one of them presently, and sometime they bring her downe that evening to the mantle, *v/*. \v.?.5.n.39/ where you may find hir covered with a little heape of Bees, otherwise the next day they carie her forth either dead or deadly wounded. Likewise if the olde Queene bring forth many Princes (as she may have six or seaven, yea sometime halfe a skore or more which superfluitie nature affordeth for more suretie, in case some miscarrie) then lest the multitude of rulers should distract the unstable commons into factions, within two daies after the last swarme, you shall finde them that remained [cw: dead]

$*and of their Queene./*/$

dead before the hive: I have taken eight of them up together brought out of one hive, when two were already gon forth with their swarmes. For the Bees abhorre as well polyarchie, as anarchie, God having shewed in them unto men an expresse patterne of a perfect monarchie, the most natural & absolute form of government. 
The Queene-bee is a Bee of a comely and stately shape, browne of colour as other Bees, \8 The description of the queene-Bee/ but that her belly is more bright: she is longer then a honi-bee, by one third part, that is almost an inch long: she is also bigger then a honi-bee but not so big as a drone, although somwhat longer: hir head proportionable, but that is more round then the little Bees, by reason hir fanges be shorter: hir tonge not halfe so long as the little Bees: for where as they gather with one nectar, with the other ambrosia, she hath no need to use either, beeing to bee maintained, as other Princes, but the labour of hir subjects; hir wings of the same size with a smal Bee, & therefore in respect of her long body, they seeme very short, for they reach but to the middle of hir nether part: hir legges, proportionable, and of the colour of hir belly, but hir two hin-legges more yellowe: hir nether part so long, and halfe so long as hir upper part, more picked then a smale Bees, and without such three whitish ringes as other Bees have at the three partitions: the speere she hath is but little, and not halfe so [cw:long] [A3]

===

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$

long as the other Bees: which, like a kings sword, is borne rather for shewe and authoritie, then for any other use: For it belongeth to her subjects, as well to fight for her, as to provide for her. \Nat.hist.li.II.cap.17./ *Plinie/* writeth thus doubtingly of it. *Non constat inter authores rex nullumne solus habeat aculeum, majestate tantum armatus, an dedent eum quidem natura, sed usum eius illi tantum negavent; illud constat imperatorem aculeo non uti/* 
But *Arist/*; doth truely approve the later opinion as certaine: \Hist.an.l.5.cap.21./ *Reges aculeos habent, sed non utuntur. Que circa carere eos aculeis nonnulli existimant./* If you desire to see this stately Prince, read ca.5.n.27 \Nat.hist.iI.c.16/ *Plinie/* describeth the Queene-bees thus, *Omnibus forma semper egregia, & duplo quam cæteris maior, pennæ breviores, crura recta, ingressus celsior, in fronte macula quodam diademate candicans: Multum etiam nitore a vulgo differunt./* \9 Bees have also inferior governors or captaines./ \10 Which are knowne by peculiar markes./
Besides their soveraigne the Bees have also subordinate governors and leaders, not unfitly resembling Captaines & coronels of soldiers: For difference from the rest they beare for their crest a tufte or toffel in some coloured yellow, in some murrey, in maner of a plume; whereof some turne downward like an ostrich-feather, others stand upright like a hearn-top. And of both sorts some are greater, and some lesse, as if there were degrees of those dignities among them. In all other respects they are like to the vulgar. These I think are they that *Plinie/* mea-

neth, where he saith, *circa regem satellites quidam lictoresque, assiduæ custodes authoritatis./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.17/ In lesse then a quarter of an houre you may see three or foure of them come forth of a good stale; but chief-ly in *Gemini/* before their continuall labour have worne these ornaments. So that he might well say \Plin.Nat.hist.Li.II.c.5/ *Rempublicam habent, consilia, ac duces./* Al which he that seriously considereth must with admiration acknowledge that singular wisdome, order, and government in them, which in no other creature, man only excepted (if yet to be excepted) is to be found; whence some have inferred a farther matter 
\Vir.Geor.4/ 
*His equidam signis atque hæc exempla sequuti, 
Esse apibus partem divinæ mentis, & haustus 
Æthereos dixere--/* 
\II *Two sorts of Bees./*/\Hist l.9?.40/ Aristotle maketh two sortes of Bees, the one (which is best) short, divers coloured, & round; the other long like unto waspes. *Optimum genus apum quæ breves variæ & in rotunditatem compactiles, secundæ quæ longæ & vespis similes./* And in an other place he putteth a difference betweene wilde and tame saying, *Differunt inter se apes parentibus natæ urbanis & qua rustico montanoque victu educatis prodierint: sunt enim ha sylvestres horridiores aspectu, & iracuudiores, & minores, sed opere & labore præstantiores./* Whom *Plinie/* followeth almost verbatim, saying *Apes sunt etiam rustica sylvestresque, horridæ aspectu, multo iracundiores, sed opere ac labore præstantiores. Urbanarum duo gene/* 
[cw: *ra/*]

===

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees,/*/$

*ra optimæ breves, variæque, & in rotuntitatem compactiles; deteriores longæ, & quibus similitudo vesparum etiamnum deterrimæ ex iis pilosæ./* But these differences my experiece hath not found, neither doe I see how they can be, seeing the swarmes of tame Bees doe often fly into trees, & so become wilde: and the swarmes of wild Bees are not seldome found, and put into hives. Indeed the wild are more angry then the tame: but that is because they are lesse used to the companie of men. Moreover there is some difference in the bignesse of Bees. For they that are loaded seeme greater and longer then those that are leene: also the Nyphs *v/* \v.c.4.n.17/: when they come first abroad are not growne to their full bignesse which afterward they have, and the old ones doe wither, and become little againe *v/* \v.n.54/: Like-wise in these three ages their colours also doe varie: for in their middle age they are browne, whereas before they are more pale, *v./* \v.c.4.n.14/ and at the last they turne whitish againe, *v./* \v.n.54/ But these are differences of Bees in the same stall, & not of one stall from another, since these diverse sorts are in every stall. 
The severall parts of a Bee have their several uses. \12 The parts of a Bee./ Hir hornes growing in the middle of hir fore-head, with two jointes, one close to the head, the other towards the middle, so that she can put them forth at full length when she wil, and drawe them in againe close to her head 
[cw: serve] 

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

serve to give warning in the darke, and when shee is busie, of any thing quicke or dead that might offend her. 
\14 *Hir fangs/*/ For gathering hir provision shee hath two instruments, hir fangs and hir tongue: hir fangs in fashion of a paire of pincers, hang not, as the jawes of other things one over an other, but side way one against the other, as is most convenient for hir uses. 
\15 *Hir tongue with the parts of it/*/ Hir tongue is of that length, that hir mouth cannot hold it, but being doubled betweene hir fangs under hir chinne, it reacheth to the necke. It is divided into three parts: whereof the two outmost serve as a case to cover the third, which being the chiefe, the Bee in hir worke putteth forth beyond the other, & draweth in againe as she wil. And this third part is likewise parted into three, so that there are five in all. 
\16 *Her fowre wings/*/ To set these instruments on worke, nature hath furnished her with fowre winges, which swifter then the East-winde carry her into all the fowre coasts of the world, and thence with hir pretious lading beare her backe againe, untill hir incessant labour hath worne them out. *v/*. \v.n.54./
\17 *Hir feete/*/ Hir rough and deuclawed feete apt to take hold at the first touch are in number six, that she may stand fast upon fowre, while she useth the other two to wipe her eies, hir wings, hir tongue, or any other part, and to convay the

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$

gathering of hir fanges to hir thighes. *v/*. \v.c.6 n.16.18/ 
\18 *Her two weapons./*/ For hir defence shee is doubly weaponed. \19 *Her fanges commonly used against insecta./*/ Hir fanges she useth when she is not much angry, against al *insecta/*, as other Bees, Drones, Waspes, &c. therewith pinching and holding them commonly by the legs or wings, & some time by the hornes: but this is rather a chiding, then a fighting, & a warning, rather then a punishment, though with al sometime shee bend hir speere against them, as if shee would kil & slay. 
\20 *Her speer sometime./*/ Hir speere she is very loth to use, if by any other meanes she can shift hir enimy, as knowing how dangerous it is to hirselfe: for if shee chance therwith to strike any hard part, as the brest or shoulder, she is enforced to leave hir speere behinde her, and so she killeth & is killed with the same stroke. Yet when the Bees are very angry; as namely when they are assalted with a multitude of robbers at once, *v/*. \v:c.7.n.34/ or when in the spring a hungry stall forsaking his owne home presseth into their hive, *v/*. \v.c.n.46/ they fal sodainly upon them with their poisoned speeres (*Apibus natura cuspides dedit, & quidem venenatas/*) \Nat.hist.li.21.c.13.21/ but then they make short worke: for by that time they have put up their weapons, some die presently, \21. *Stinging present death to Bees./*/ others loosing the use of their wings tumble on the ground like mad things, until in a while they loose their lives too: others when they are wounded run away in great hast (as having their

$*and of their Queene./*/$

errand) either drawing on the ground one or more of their legs, or doubling their nether part toward the ground, or turning the same awry to the one side or the other: but as many as are striken, within an howre after will not be able to wagge out of the place, and within two or three at the most, they will be quite dead. I have looked on, while thus they quickly cut of a whole stale, and among them the rest, making then no difference, they spared not the Queene her selfe. After this maner doe they deale with the drones at the time of the yeare, when they wil not otherwise be beaten away. 
\22 *The speares commonly used against other creatures/*/ But their speares or stings they use chiefly against things of other sort, as men, beastes, and fowles, which have outwardly some offensive excrement, as haire or feathers, the touch wherof provoketh them to sting; \23 *Haire & feathers cause the Bees to sting./*/ although such stinging be alwaies mortall to themselves (as anon is shew'd *v/*) \*v.n.27.28./*/ for the skin having received the sting holdeth it so fast, that when they would be gon they leave both it and part of their entralls which are fastned to it. *Aculeum apibus natura dedit ventri consertum/*. \Nat.hist.I.II.c.18/ If they light upon poultry although their desire be to the quicke, if they can quicklie come at it, yet will they put forth their speers as soone as they touch the feather; and if they chance to hit the hard part thereof the sting sticketh fast, as in the skin: and therefore goose wings are naught to be used in the hiving of Bees. *v/*. \v.c.5.n.45./ 
[cw: Like-]

=== 

$*Of the nature & properties of Bees/*/$

Likewise if they light upon the hair of your head or beard, (save only when they come home loden, or the weather is colde) they wil sting if they can reach the skin, \24 *Woole and wollen do not offend them./*/ although woole and wollen do not offend them: & if being otherwise angered they strike their speeres in woollen, they can easily pul them out againe: \25 *Fustian leather, & velvet naught among Bees./*/ But the nap of new fustian displeaseth them, because it seems hairy, and the stuffe is so fast, that it holdeth the sting. Wherefore such apparel is not fit among Bees: as also lether in gloves or otherwise, for assone as they touch it they wil strike, if they bee any whit mooved, and their speeres they cannot recover againe. Velvet in facing of hats or elsewhere doth anger them as much as any thing, making them strike assone as they touch it: but it hath not power to hold their speere. \26 *The Bees in their anger aime at the head./*/ When they are angrie their aime is most commonly at the head, and chiefly about the eies as knowing that there they may do most harme, for that part swelleth most and longest: and yet I never heard that anie ever stung the very eie, as if they were forbidden to touch that tender part. But the bare hande that is not very hairy, they will seldome or never sting, unlesse they be much offended.
\27 *When any is stung the company must be one/*/ When you are stung, or any in the company, yea though a Bee have striken but your clothes, specially in hot wether, you were best be packing as fast as you can: for the other Bees smel-

ling the rancke favour of the poison cast out with the sting wil come about you as thicke as haile: so that fitly and lively did he expresse the multitude & fiercenes of his enimies that said *They came about me like Bees./* Then is there no way to appease them but flight, the more you resist the fiercer they are. They are like unto incorrigible shrews: there is no dealing with them but by patience, though when they sting they are sure to have the worst. \28 *The Bees have the worst when they sting/*/ For the wound endangereth nether life nor limb: two nights sleepe will take awaie the swelling, and two minutes the paine (unlesse it be in verie reumatik or humorous bodies: of which sorte I have knowne some so swollen and disfigured with that little stroke, that you could scarce knowe them by their favour in five or six daies after.) \29 *They loose their sting and entrals & consequently their lives/*/ But on the other side, whereas the waspe, hornet, and dorre, do sting often without any hurt to themselves, the Bee never stingeth but once and then shee leaveth hir speere and entrals more or lesse behinde her, *animamque in vulnere ponit./* \*Virg. Georg./* Hist.an.l9.c40./ *(Intereunt quæ percusserint, quoniam fine intestins eruptione aculeus eximi non potest)./* For within fowre and twentie howres after, or, if much of his entrals come forth with the sting, within halfe that time shee dieth: \30 *The speere of it selfe pearceth deeper when the Bee is gon./*/ But the speere reteining life when the Bee is gone, if it be not presentlie pulled out, will worke it selfe into the flesh up to the hard end, & so cause the paine

and swelling to bee both greater and longer. 
\31 *How to prevent the paine and swelling/*/ Therefore when you are stung, instantlie wipe of the Bee, sting and all, & wash the place with your spittle: so shal you prevent both paine & swelling, which otherwise nothing but time can cure: for the posion is so subtill that it quicklie pierceth the flesh, \32 *Nothing but time can cure their stinging/*/ and the wound so little that no antidote can followe after: and yet I have heard commended for a remedie the joice of houseleeke, of rue, of malows, of ivie, of a marigold leafe, of holyhock and vinegar, of sault & vineger, and divers other things. 

\33 *what things the Bee-master must avoid/*/ But if thou wilt have favour of thy Bees that they sting thee not, thou must avoid such things as offend them: thou must not be (1) unchast or (2) uncleanly: for impurity & sluttishness (themselves being most chast and neate,) they utterly abhorre: thou must not come among them (3) smelling of sweat, or having a stinking breath caused either through eating of leekes, onions, garleeke, and the like; or by any other meanes: the noisomnes whereof is corrected with a cup of beere, and therefore it is not good to come among them before you have drunk thou must not be given to (4) surfeting & drunkennes: thou must not come (5) puffing & blowing or sweating unto them, nether hastily stirre among them, nor violently defend thy

\35. *Safer to walke then stand among Bees/*/ At any time, when nothing hath angered them one may boldly walke along by your Bees: but if he stand still before them within the space of a pearch in the heate of the day, it is marvaile but one or other spying him from the hive wil have a cast at him. 
\36 *The fittest time to stirre about Bees is in the morning/*/ If you have any thing to doe about your hives, the fittest time is in the morning, before the sun be hot, or otherwise in cold, wet, or windie wether, for then they will not sting, unlesse they be much provoked. They are also very gentle in the evenings; but then being wearie if you stand in their way you trouble their lighting, and cause them to fall, & if you make them come forth when they are housed for al night, they can hardly see to get in againe. *v./* \*v.n./*41/

they are soone angrie, and very eager. \38 *How to bee armed when the Bees are angrie/*/ Wherefore if at such time, you have occasion to trouble them, or to come among them being already chased, cover your face with cipres or boulter, having a handkerchiefe betweene it and your forehead to beare it out from the skin, & your hat on your head to hold it fast, so shall you save your face and yet see what you doe: & if they be so earnest, that you feare stinging your hands, put on a paire of wollen gloves, & so are you armed at all points.
\39 *Bees dangerous to cattaile./*/ Unto cattale which have not reason by flight or otherwise to save themselves they are more dangerous. A horse in the heate of the day looking over a hedge, on the other side whereof was a staule of Bees, while hee stood nodding with his head, as his maner is, because of the flies, the Bees fell upon him and killed him. Likewise I heard of a teeme that stretching against a hedge overthrew a staule on the other side, and so two of the horses weree stung to death. I doubt not but through negligence many mischances have happened elsewhere. For this thing hath beene long since observed by that great philosopher. *Necant/* (saith he) *vel maxima animalia ictu sui aculei: jam equus occisus ab apibus est./* \Arist.hist.an.l.9.c.40/

*animum, artem quis facile crediderit./* \41 *their sight dim./*/ Of all the senses their sight seemeth to be weakest: and weaker when they come home loaded, then when they are leere, and being loaded weaker on foot then when they are flying. If when they come home loaded, they light beside the dore, they will goe up and downe seeking for it, as if they were in the darke: & unlesse by chance they hit upon it, they must fly againe before they can finde it. As many as fall beside the stoole when it waxeth darke, ten to one they ly abroad all night: yea if at such time being troubled by any thing they come forth from the stoole, though then they be fresh and lusty they wil leape up and downe, runne and fly to and fro til they be wearie; but by no meanes can they finde the way in againe. And therefore is it that when they fly abroad, they take such paines at the doore in rubbing and wiping their glazen eies, that they may the better discerne their way forth and back. 
\42 *The smelling very quick./*/ But their smelling is excellent, whereby, when they fly aloft in the aier, they wil quickly perceave any thing under them that they like, as hony or tarre, though it be covered: as soone as the honi-dew is falen, they presently winde it, though the Okes that receive it *v./* \*V.c.6.n/*.38/ be a far of which the Poet, speaking of the excellencie of some creatures in this sense before others, doth thus expresse

And by this sense they finde out any strange Bee, which is not otherwise to be knowne from their owne company, & that in the dark hive: where, when they are disposed, they will by the same meanes cull out the drones, yea and pull out the cephens that are shut up in the cells, not medling with an of their own sex. 
\43 *Hearing & feeling/*/ Their heareing and feeling are very quicke. If you touch their hives but lightly, they presentlie perceiving it, make a generall noise: although \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40/ *Aristotle/* doubt whether they heare, or not. *Quanquam incertum est an audiant./* But if they did not heare, to what purpose is that musicke made in the hives, before the swarming? *v.c. 5. n 23./*
\44 *Tasting/*/ And of their fift sense I make no question, sithens they are used to things of so different tasts although there may seeme the lesse use of it, because their smelling is so perfect.
\45 *Their virtues/*/ And such are their outward senses. The inward faculties of thier mindes are farre more excellent. \46. *Fortitude/*/ In valour and magnanimitie they surpasse all creatures: there is nothing so huge and mightie that they feare to set upon, and when they have once begunne, they are invincible: for nothing can make them yeeld but death: so great hearts doe they carrie in so little bodies.

But above all, one excellent skill they have which the most excellent femals, though much they desire it, must yeeld themselves to want: for they knowe certainelie when they breed a male, and when a female: which thing appeareth by this, that they laie their cephen-feedes in a wide combe by them selves, *v./* \v.c.6.n.8./ and the Nymph-seedes in the rest, which are of a smaller size. *v./* \v.c.6.n.7.

If I should relate the storie al men, I knowe, would not beleeve it; not withstanding because every man maie make some use of it, you shall have it. 
\48 *A strange tale concerning the knowledge & devotion of Bees./*/ A certain simple woman having some stals of Bees which yeelded not unto hir desired profit, but did consume & die of the murraine; made her mone to another woman more simple then hir selfe: who have her councel to get a consecrated host or round Godamighty and put it among them. According to whose advise she went to the priest to receive the host: which when she had done, she kept it in hir mouth, & being come home againe she tooke it out and

$*and of their Queene./*/$

put it into one of hir hives. Whereupon the murraine ceased, and the hony abounded. The woman therefore lifting up the hive at the due time to take out the honie, sawe there (most strange to be seene) a chappel built by the Bees with an altar in it, the wals adorned by marvelous skil of architecture with windowes conveniently set in their places: also a dore and a steeple with bels. And the host being laid upon the altar, the bees making a sweet noise flew around it. \Tho.Bozius de signis Eccles.lib.14.c.3./
But whether this doe more argue the supernatural knowledge and skil of the Bees, or the miraculous power of the host, or the spiritual craftines of him, whose comming is by the working of Satan with al power and signes and lying wonders, it may be some wil make a question: and presuming to examin every particular circumstance over narrowly, wil make objections against the truth of the story: which, by their leaves, in the behalfe of my author I must not spare to answere. First it may be that they wil object that the host being held so long in the womans mouth could not choose in that space but melt and marre. Indeed, if it did remaine, as it was, a wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but being turned into flesh it is an absurd assertion. If they shal say that because, it was now honi-harvest, at which time good stals, such as this was, are ful of wax and hony, that therefore

there could not be roome enough for a chapel with a steeple and bels in it; I answere that this is as weake and simple as the former. For seeing it is knowne that a blacke smith of London did make a locke and key so little that a flie could draw it; why should not the little smith of Nottingham (whose art is thought to excel al art of man) frame a little chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they wil reply, if we grant you this, howe then could the Bees flie about the altar in that little chappel, seeing they are not able to flie in so narrow a roome as the empty hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: happily the woman said they did but crawle. If they shal aske how the woman could see the altar with the host standing in the chancel & the bels hanging in the steeple, seeing the waxen wals were not transparent, they maie easilie thinke that the Bees would give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if they shal say that those bels being made of such metall would give but a weake sounde when they were runge to matins; they must consider the parishoners dwelt not far of. And so I thinke these captious criticks wil hold themselves satisfied. 
Unto this storie my author immediately addeth an other, like unto it, and as likely: how certaine theeves having stollen the silver boxe wherein the wafer-Gods use to lie, & finding [cw:one]

one of them there, being loath, belike, that he should lie abroad all night, did not cast him away, but laid him under a hive: whom the Bees acknowledging advanced to an high roome in the hive, and there in steede of his silver boxe made him an other of the whitest wax & when they had so done, in worshippe of him, at set howres they sung most sweetly beyond al measure about it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight with a light and al. Wherewith the bishop being made acquainted, came thither with many others: & lifting up the hive he saw there neere the top a most fine box, wherein the host was laid, and the quires of Bees singing about it, and keeping watch in the night, as Monkes do in their cloisters. The bishop therefore taking the host caried it with the greatest honour into the church: whether many resorting were cured of innumerable diseases. 
I doubt not but some incredulous people wil quarrel this story as wel as the former, making question since the combs in the top of the hive are not past halfe an inch one from an other, how there could bee roome for a box of that breadth that would containe the host, & then being there, how it might be seene by the Bishoppe, seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees, and the story saith that they were then singing about it: and therefore perhaps they wil suspect the whole narration, supposing

it rather to be an unadvised devise of some idle monk, which, if he had consulted with them that have skil among Bees, might have made his tale more probable. Alleadging moreover that therefore there is no mention made of my particular person, time, or place, least the circumstances should disprove the matter it selfe. All which objections I could as easily answere as the former, if I thought it needful. But now because some may bee as ready to mistrust my relation, as others are to object against the truth of the stories, I wil here in mine owne behalfe for their satisfaction set downe in my authors owne words. 
*Cum mulier quædam simplicis ingenii nonnulla apum aluearia possideret, neque illæ redderent expectitum fructum, sed lue quadam tabescentes morerentur: de consilio alterius fœminæ simplicioris, accessit, ad sacerdotem perceptura eucharistiam: quam sumptam tamen ore continuit, domumque reversa extractam collocavit in uno ex alveariis.

The conclusion, which my author necessarily inferreth hereupon, is better then all the rest. *Ex his necesse est dicamus in Eucharistia verum C. corpus esse./* But if thou wilt grant me that hereby is proved the incredible knowlesge & skill of the Bees, for my part I wil urge thee no farther.

But indeed I cannot much commend their justice towards strangers, for all that they can catch is their owne: unlesse they may bee excused in this respect, that the Bees of divers hives are at deadly feud, or rather as kingdomes, that are at defiance one with another. *v.c.7.n.23./*

\53 *The age of Bees/*/ Anent the age of Bees there are divers opinions: some thinke that they may live 4, or 5 yeares, yea some 6, or 7. \Georg. 4 Hist.l.5.c.22/ (*neque enim plus septima ducitor æstas.

#CHAP. 2/#

\*Of 5 things requisit in a bee garden, the first is that it be night at hand/*/ 
{F}Or your bee-garden first choose some plot nigh your home, that the Bees may be in sight & hearing, because of swarming, fighting, or other sodaine happe, wherein they may need your presente helpe. 
Your garden of herbes & flowres is fit for the purpose. *Hortis coronamentisque, maxime alvearia & apes conveniunt; res præcipus quæstus compendiique cum favit./* \Nat.hist.li.21.c.12./
\2. *That it be safely fenced from cattaile and windes./*/ See it be safe, and surely fenced, not online from al cattaile (which if they breake in maie quickelie spoile both the Bees & themselves) and specially from swine (which by rubbing against the hives, and tearing the hacles in a wantonnes are most apt to overthrow the stalles) but also from the violence of the windes, that when the Bees come laden and weary home, they maie settle quietlie. 
\3 *The north and east fences should be high/*/ The north-fence of your garden shoulde be close and high, that the cold winde of that coast, which blowing against the Bees coming

$*Of the placing of your stalls./*/$

home wearie would throwe downe & kill manie, maie be altogether kept from them. And therefore, if it maie be, set your Bees on the south side of your house; which will not onlie defend them from that unholesome winde, but also by reflection double the heate of the sun shining on the wal, & so comfort them much, speciallie in the winter and spring. 
The east fence also would be good & high to keepe from the Bees as well the sun, as the winde. For the sun rising doth oftimes till thenceforth, when the aire is colder then they can indure; and the East wind being cold and sharpe is verie unkind for Bees, speciallie in the spring. 
\4 *The south & west fences must be also good but not so high as to hide the sun from the hives./*/But in no wise let the place be shadowed from the south-sun: for that doth not onlie dry the hives & relieve the Bees in the winter and spring, but also causeth them to swarme in summer, if it be not extreame hot and drie *v./* \*v.c./*5.n.19./
Nor yet from the sun setting: because in calme and pleasant weather the Bees wil be in field after the sun is down, even as long as they can there see: and if they returne, they finde it darke at home, manie of them; their sight being but dim, *v/*. \C.I.n.41/ fall short or wide: which flying and running to and fro til they be wearie, at length yeeld to the cold dew.

other: yet are they no lesse violent, and more frequent: so that they also do much harme, specially in the spring. \5 *In rough winds Bees need a skreene./*/ And therefore if at that time of the yeare in rough & boisterous winds you find that the garden-fences doe not sufficiently garde and defend them; then it is good to set up wixed or lined hurdles, or some other skreene betweene them and the weather. For though they can shift abroad in the strongest windes, as a ship that has sea-roome; yet are they easily overthrowne at the hive, as the ship is soone wrecked at the haven. 
\6 *That it be sweet/*/ 3. That the place be sweete, not annoyed with any stinking savour. I have knowne a stall in the spring being sufficiently provided of hony, & having bred yong, to forsake all because of poultry that roosted in a tree over them. \Nat.hist.li.II.c.18./ *Odere fœdes odores, proloque, fugiut/*: And yet the smel of urin doth not offend them; nay they wil be very busy where it is shed. It is thought they use it for physike. *Remedium contra alui concitationem est urina hominum vel boum./*
\7 *Neither very cold in winter nor over hot in sommer/*/ 4 That it be neither very cold in winter nor very hot in sommer. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Locus æstate non fervidus, hyeme tepidus./* A bare flower is naught in both seasons: because in winter it is over cold and by that meanes quickly chilleth the Bees that light upon it; and in sommer it causeth them to lie forth through excessive heate, *v./* \v.c.5.n.19./ A grassie ground therefore is best at all times: but let it

be kept notte in summer & dry in winter; \8 *A grassie ground is best kept not and drie/*/ for long grasse and weedes about the hive doe but harbour the bees enimies, *v./* \v.c.7.n.4&18/ and hinder both their passage in and out, and their rising againe when they fall short: and water, if it stand, not only maketh the place drie and fowle, but also causeth mustines within, and increaseth the colde without: both which are noisome to the Bees. 
\9 *Beset with trees and bushes/*/ 5 That it be conveninently be set with trees & bushes fit to receive the swarmes, as plumtrees, cheritrees, apletrees, filberds, hazels, thornes, roses, &c. Although, if they be willing to stay, they will not refuse a dead hedge, a lavender border, or the like, or sometimes the bare ground. For want of trees, some have stucke up greene boughs, and the Bees have lighted upon them. 
\10 *Two sorts of seates/*/ The place being thus fitted, the seates are to be provided: which, whether they be stools or benches, must be set a little shelving, that the raine may neither run into the hive, nor stay at the dore. 
\11 *The benches not so good as single stooles./*/ To set many stals upon a bench (as many use to do) is not best: for that in sommer it may cause the bees to fight, as having easie accesse on foot to each other, and standing so neere that they shall sometime mistake the next hive for their own: & in winter the bench wil be alwaies wet, which looseth the cloome,

rotteth the bottome of the hive, & offendeth the bees: and the mouse at all times hath free passage from one to an other, without feare.
\12 *Swarmes may be set on benches/*/ The single stooles therefore are best. And yet it is not amisse to set most of your swarms upon benches, before the old stals: from whence remove them to the stooles, when the stals are taken: and then set up the benches til an other yeere. 
\13 *Wooden stooles better than they of stone./*/ The best stoooles are of wood: those of stone are too hote in hot weather, & (which is worse) too cold in cold. 
\14 *The size of stooles/*/ For their size they shoulde not bee above halfe an inch or an inch without the hive: save only before where there needeth the space of five or *6./* inches, that the Bees may have roome enough to light upon, specially then, when the sight of a rainy clowd sendeth them thronging home. Three inches of which fore-part next the hive must remaine flat for the porch to stand upon *v./* \v.c.3.n.25/ the rest is to be cut shelving that it may the better avoid the raine. And therfore if the hive be 15. inches over, the stoole shoulde not be abive 16. or 17. inches one way, and 21. or 22. at the most the other way. 
\15 *Which was the stooles should be set/*/ These stooles would be set toward the south or rather southwest, that the hive may somwhat breake the East-winde from the dore, *v./* \v.not.3./ and that the dore may be lightened by the sun setting when they returne late from field. *v./* \v.not.4/

\16 *How neere to the fence/*/ And if the north fence be a wal, pale, or hedge, let them stande some two feet from the fence that you may go about the hives to see & mend what is amisse: but if it be a house-side, then set them 2. feet without the evesdropping, lest the raine rebounding from the gutter moisten the hives. 
\17 *How neere to each other./*/ They should also stand in straight rankes or rewes from east to west 4 feet, or at the least 3. feet and a halfe from one another measuring from dore to dore, not only that you may have roome enough to go rounde about every one, but also that the Bees when they come back home in hast, specially when a swarme goeth backe againe, may al fly into their own hive. For if they stand neere togither, at such a time many wil take the next hive for their own, and then they fal togither by the eares, *v./* \*V.c.5.n.55/*/ & the nymphs also, when they go first abroad, wil by that occasion the sooner mistake: which if they doe, they die. Neverthelesse if the swarmes upon the benches stand but 2. feet apart, it is enough: but alwaies lay a Rest, *v./* \*V.c.n.39/*/ or other sticke of three inches thicke, as marches betweene them to keepe the peace. 
The ranks should bee placed sixe or seaven feete, or five at the least one before another, that so not only the Bees, but the sun also may come without let to every hive. 
\18 *How neere to the ground./*/ Also they should not stande above two feet

from ground because of the winde; nor under one foot for the dampnes of the ground in winter, which would make the hives moist & mustie; and for the heat of the ground in sommer, which in hote and dry wether would make the Bees lie out, and so hinder both their worke & swarminge. *v/* \V.c.5.n.19./
If you have but one ranke, the best highth is one foot and a halfe. If you have many, it is convenient that the most northward rankes stand highest, & the most southward lowest, descending by degrees from two feet to one: as if there be two rews of stooles let the first stand 2. feete from ground, the next 18 inches, and all the benches one foote. If there be three rankes beside the benches, let the second be twenty inches, and the third sixteene. 
\19 *How to bee footed/*/ The stone-stooles must bee footed as they may, the fashion of each place where they are used wil direct you. But the plankes or wooden stooles are either to have fowre feete made of the hart of oak, or of some other lasting wood; or to be fastned to one foote with two wooden pins: which foor let me made of sound timber 5 or 6 inches over; and of that length that it may be set betweene fifteene and eighteene inches in the ground. The fower feet are fittest for the higher stooles, and the single foote for the lower.
