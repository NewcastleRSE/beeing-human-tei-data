#*Of the hives, and the dressing of them./*/#
##CHAP. 3./##
\1 *Two sorts of hives./*/ {I}N some countries they use strawne hives bound with briar: in some wicker hives made of privet, withy, or hazell, dawbed usually with cowcloome tempered with gravelly dust or sand or ashes.
\2 *Strawne-hives with their inconveniences & remedies./*/ The strawne hives when they are olde and loded, unlesse they be very hard wrought, doe usually sinke on one side, specially if they take wet, and so breake the combes and let out the hony: and the nether part of them is apt to be rotted with the moisture of the stoole: For which cause it is good to reare them an inch from the stoole with three strong spleetes, equally distant, and thrust into the bottome toward the top as high as you can, alwaies keeping them in the middle of the rowles: and so shal you also prevent that other inconvenience, & keepe the hives upright. 
\3 *Wicker-hives with their inconvenineces & remedies./*/ The wicker hives wil still be at fault, and lie open, if they be not often repaired, unto wasps, robbers, and mise. Any of these, if shee find but

a little chap, will dig hir way in: and the mouse (unlesse the twigs bee close wrought) though shee find none. 
Both these hives, if they be not wel covered, are subject to wet, which maketh them mustie, and, if it be much, rotteth the combes and destroieth the Bees. But the heate in summer, the colde in winter, and the raine at all times doth soonest pearce the wicker hives: for which cause it is good to double-dawbe them.
\4 *Strawnhives best./*/ All things considered the strawne hives are better, specially for smal swarmes.
\5 *The size of hives./*/ The hives should conteine betweene a bushel and a halfe, as the time of the yeare, and quantitie of the swarme doth require: how to fit the hives to the swarmes see *c./*5 *n./*37.
Have alwaies hives enough of al sizes in store, least they be to seeke when you should use them.
\6 *When hives are to be made./*/ The  best time for making of them, whether they be strawn or wicker, is in the three dead months of winter *Saggit. Capricorn./*& *Aquar. v./*  \*v.n./*51/ for then the straw, briars, & twigges are best in season. 
\7 *How hives are to be dressed before they receive the swarmes./*/ Your hive being ready is thus to be dressed. First cut awaie all those staring strawes, twigs or other offensive ragges that are fast in the hive, making the inside as smooth as may be: but first (specially if it be a strawn hive) rub it a good round about with a linnen cloath, that so \8 *The pruning of hives/*/ [cw: you] [C4]

===

$*Of the hives/*/$
you may the sooner remove those that ar loose. For these obstacles, if they cause not the Bees to forsake the hive, yet will they much trouble and hinder them: you may heare them, (specially in the night) scraping and gnawing three or fowr daies after they be hived, yea sometime a week together, as though there were mise in the hive. And in strawn hives, if you help them not, a long time after.
\9 *The spraying or spleeting of them./*/ 2. Then take a straight hazel or willow-stick and quarter it, if it be big enough, otherwise slit it: and then shave and smooth the cleaftes; which being of a convenient strength & length put three of them in a hive, setting the upper endes together in the top of the hive, and the nether ends equally distant one from an other within a handfull of the bottome. But if the hive be more then fourteene inches over within, it may wel receive foure spleets. And this is the easiest & quickest way of spleeting a hive: it is also strong enough for bearing the combs, and best for taking them forth without breaking. Besides which there are divers sortes of spleeting, needlesse to be rehearsed: for every country hath his fashion. 
\10 *The seasoning of them./*/ 3 Lastly in swarming time season the hives that you meane to use, rubbing them with sweete herbes such as the Bees love, as time, savourie, majoram, baulme, fenell, hysop, malowes, charlock, &c. And when the swarme is [cw: setled]

===

$*and the dressing of them/*/$

settled, take the hive that you thinke fit for it in bignesse, *v./* \*V.c.5.n./*37./ and with a branch of hazel, oake, willow, or any of the foresaid herbes, but chiefly with a sprig of that tree whereon the swarme lighted, wipe the hive cleane, and then dipping it into meth, or faire water mixed with a little hony, or with milke and salt, or for a need with salt only besprinkle the same.
\11 *The seasoning of an old hive./*/ But if the hive have beene used before, after you have pared away the wax as cleane as may be, if you thinke the former dressing will not make it sweete enough, then let a hogge eate 2 or 3 handfuls of mault, or pease, or other corne in the hive: mean while doe you so turne the hive, that the fome or froth, which the hogge maketh in eating, may goe all about the hive. And then wipe the hive lightly with a linnen cloath, and so will the Bees like this hive better than a new. But if you use it not the same day, then besprinkle it also, when you doe use it, as is shewed before. And so serve a new hive when the Bees are so froward, that they will not otherwise abide. 
\12 *How hives are to be ordered when the Bees are in them./*/ And thus are the hives to be prepared and dressed, before they receive the Bees. Now will I shew you how they are afterward to be ordered throughout the yeare.
\13 *The hives alwaies well hacled./*/ 1. First let them be alwaies wel covered, that they may be safe in summer from heat, lest, the wax melting, the combes fal down; *v./* \*V.c./* 7. *n./* 49./ in winter from [cw: cold] 

$*Of the hives/*/$

cold, least it kil the Bees; *v/* \*v.c./*7.*n./*51./ and at al times from raine, least it corrupt first the hive, afterward the combes, and at last the Bees also. *v./* \*v.c./* 7 *n/* 54/
\14 *How to make a hacle. /*/ The best cover for hives is a thicke hacle: *Alvearia stramento operiri utilissimum./* Which is thus to bee made. Take fowre or five handfuls of wheat or rie leased out of the sheafe: which being bound up severally beat out the corne; & then casting away their bands draw out the eares of each handfull longer on the one side then on the other: and putting the long sides togither (so to make the forme of a taper or pyramis for shooting the raine) binde them al in one under the eares as fast as you can, with a thong, cord, or other strong string. 
\15 *The working of the cap/*/ And then, to make a band or cap for this pyramis or head of your hacle, lease out of the sheafe almost a handfull of the strongest straw, and lay it in soake about a quarter of an howre. Being thus prepared take out of that wet bundel some 40. or 50. reedes or strawes, and laying halfe of them one way and halfe the other, that the band may be of equall bignes, take them up togither; and then mingling one end of the reeds with the middle reeds of the head, and twisting them fast togither in your hand, let the band harle or double in the very top of the head: and so begin to binde the head round, working downeward, and stil twisting the band as you go. When those reedes are wel-nigh wrought up, take out of the wet [cw: bundle] 

===

$*and the dressing of them/*/$

bundle so many more prepared as before: and when you have mingled one end thereof with the end of the other, holding them in your hand twist them fast togither: and so continue your worke, alwaies binding as hard as you can, and bearing up every role close to his fellow. When you are come downe to the string, loose it, and binde the last or lowest role in the place thereof, making fast the end, by forcing it up betweene the head and the cap with a forked sticke and a mallet. 
\16 *The bignesse of the hacle./*/ The hacle thus made of fowre or five handfuls wil conteine in compasse close under the cap betweene 14. and 18. inches: fourteene wil serve for the smaller hives, & eighteene for the greatest, although they be five feet about. 
\17 *The length of it./*/ For the length of the hacles, each one is to be fitted to his hive, so that the skirts thereof may reach to the stoole, or within halfe an inch of it round about, save only the space of fowre or five inches on each side the dore, where it must be pared somewhat shorter, that the Bees passage be not hindered. \18 *The girdle./*/ And then with a smal pliant girdle of bethwin, or the like gird the hacle close to the hive in the middle or biggest part of it, least the winde disorder it. If there be any crook or bout in the girdle, set that before, that the hacle, bearing in that place farther out, may shoot the water from the dore: otherwise, for that purpose, set the girdle from what high- [cw: er] 

=== 

$*Of the hives/*/$

er before then behinde. 
\19 *The hives alwaies close cloomed/*/ Next keepe the hives alwaies close for defence of the bees against their enimies. The best cloome for that purpose is made of neates dunge: *circumlini alveos fimo bubulo utilissimum/*: \Nat hist. li 21. cap. 14./ but let it be tempered and hardened with clay or other morter, or for a neede with ashes, against the wet; and with sand or gravel against the gnawing of Mise. With this cloome close up the skirts and brackes of your hives, that there be no way into them but only by the dores.
\20 *Then seldome to be moved./*/ And being thus safely shut, move them not without urgent occasion. *v./* \*V.n./* 33.44.*&/* c.8.*&/*9/ for often lifting up the hive and letting in the open aire doth discourage the stall. \21 *How a hive lifted up is to bee put downe again/*/ But whensoever you are occasioned to do (the Bees being stirring) lest any be crushed betweene the skirts & the stoole in setting it downe againe, teele up one side with a little tile-sharde, which, when the Bees are quiet, take away, & see the hive close cloomed againe. 
\22. *The bignes of the hive dore./*/ The hive-dore must be made as little as may be, the Bees having easie passage to & fro, not letting one an other: and therfore great flights must have the greater dores, and little flightes the lesse.  The greater dores may contein about 4. square inches, as being 4. inches wide, & one inch, or at the least three quarters of an inch high: the lesse need be but 3. inches wide.
Unto the hive-dore there belong a barre, a [cw: porch]

===

$*and the dressing of them./*/$
porch, and a porch-dore: which for the safety of the Bees are to be used in their times, as anon in this chapter shal be shewed.
\23 *The making of the barre./*/ The barre is to be made of a piece of lath, trencher, or other thin wood an inch broad, & fowre inches long: in the nether edge whereof you must cut a holownes 3 inches long & almost halfe an inch high, so leaving halfe an inch at each ende uncut. And this will serve for most stalls: but if you have any so good, that they can not, easilie or without let, passe through this single barre; then for them cut an other holownesse above, of the former length, and but one quarter of an inch high, leaving the space betweene the two passages a quarter of an inche. The forme of which barres both single & double you may see in these figures. 

{Diagram or pattern}

\24 *The use of it/*/ The use of the barre is to streighten the passage where there needeth not so much roome, & to keep out the enimie when the porch is from it. *v./* \*V.n./*33/ [cw: The]

$*Of the hives/*/$

\25 *The making of the porch./*/ The concavitie or holownesse of the porch must be an inch in length or widenes from east to west, almost halfe an inch in heighth, and an inch and a halfe and better in thicknes from the hive outward. And it is to be made of a piece of wood two inches long, one inch high, & two inches thicke: of the which two inches, an inch and a halfe and a litle more must serve for the thicknesse of the concavitie: and the nether part of the rest being taken away, there must be a chanel cut in the upper part, in which the dore is to slide to and fro. The fashion of which porch you may best understand by the figure of one ende, thus represented. 

{Diagram}

Out of one square sticke, an inch one way and two inches the other & twenty in length, you may cut halfe a skore. For great swarmes and full stalls, which cannot easily passe through these porches, make them an inch and a halfe wide, and then the wood must bee two inches and a halfe long.
\26 *The use of it./*/ The porch having this long and streight passage, the theife will not be so hasty to enter, & if she doe, ten to one shee is met with before she can get through, and sent back againe with [cw: a] 

===

$*and the dressing of them/*/$

a flea in her eare. 2. The porch serveth also to breake the force of the cold winde and frost in winter, which is very hurtfull unto the Bees. 3. and withall keepeth out the mise, which in winter wont to make most spoile. *v/* \*v.c./*7.*n./*4./ 
\27 *The making of the porch-dore./*/ The porch-dore is to be made of a peice of thin wood, as a lath, trencher, chip, or the like: of the length of the porch, of that thicknesse that it may slide to and fro in the chanell, and of that breadth that it may reach from the stoole to the top of the chanell. In the middle cut a breathing place, so long as the widenesse of the porch, and so narrow that a Bee cannot passe. \28 *The use of it/*/ With this dore you may shut or halfe-shut the porch as you shall see cause. 
\29 *The greese./*/Unto these may be added a greese or ascent, which may be a planck or bord of the breadth of the stoole at least, and of that length that it may stand leaning from the ground to the forepart of the stoole; that thereon the Bees may settle when they come weary or thronging home, and so ascend to the dore, and that there they may sun & refresh themselves being chilly & wearie. It may also be made of two bords, the broader the better, or for a neede, of many lathes fastned together with 3 ledges, which, if they be outward, may save the Bees from falling when they misse their hold. 
\30 *How to order the Beehives in every month, & first in GEMINI./*/ From *Gemini/* to *Leo/* let the dores *v./* stand wide open, that there may bee roome for the [cw: swarmes] 

===

$*and the dressing of them./*/$
\*v.n./*22/ swarmes to passe at pleasure, all which time there is no feare of enimies. 
\31 CANCER./ *Gemini/* being past, if the weather be usually not hot, when there commeth a calme warme day, take of the hackles from those hives that are likely to swarme. \32 *How to make the Bees swarme./*/ But if the weather be extreame hot and dry, then is it good to coole the hives, and to put in the Bees which will then lie forth. *v./* \*v.c./* 5 *n./* 20./ 
If you then desire that any of your two-yeere stalls, which have not yet swarmed, should swarme, see whether the combs reach within an inch of the stoole: if they doe not, make a false bottome to reach to that scantlet. *v.n./*41.
\33. *How to keepe them from swarming./*/ When you would have no more swarmes, as namely after the first blowing of blackberies, *v./* \*v.c./*5.*n/* 11./ which is commonly within a sevennight after Midsommer, set up those hives that are full with three tile-shards, or other thinges of like thicknes, & cloome up the space betweene the hive & the stoole: \34 *How to keepe full stalls from killing their yong./*/ whereby you shall not only stay the Bees from swarming, but also keepe them from killing their yong. 
\35 LEO/ For in *Leo/* those that are already very full of Bees, whether they be good swarmes or stockes, doe oftimes kill their later brood, some fledge, some before they can fly, lest they should be thronged for want of roome, knowing that then it is to late for them to goe forth in swarmes. [cw:At]

===

$*and the dressing of them./*/$ 
\36 *Fasten the barre to the dore./*/ At *Leo/*, when swarming is past, to the dores of the weaker stalles (whether they be small swarmes, or stockes that have twise swarmed) fasten the barre *v./* with good cloome. \*v.n./* 23./
\37. VIRGO./ At *Virgo/* or a little before, which is the most dangerous time for Bees, because of the waspes that then, if not sooner, learne the way into the hives, but chiefly of robbing Bees, which then begin to spoile, *v./* \*v.c.7.n.26./*/ first bee sure that the hives be close in all places: then fasten the barrs either single or double, as you shall see cause, to such hives as are full of Bees: and to the weaker sort, which were barred in *Leo/*, set up the porch *v./* \*v.25/*/ and cloome it fast.
\38 *To keepe the hives from robbing./*/ \*v.c.7.n.26./*/
\39 *Set up the porch to the weaker./*/ \*v.25/*/
\40 *And keepe them shut til they offer to goe abroad./*/ Moreover because the waspes and robbing Bees wilbe stealing betimes, before the true Bees are stirring; it is good in the evening when the Bees are all in, to shut the porch of those that are weake, that a Bee cannot passe: & not to open the same the next day till the weather be warme, and the Bees offer to come abroad, though it be not before 9. 0r 10. 0r 11. a clock: and then you may ether open it or halfe-open it, according to the flight of your Bees. *v./* \*v.n./*25/
\41 *How hives not full ar to be used against colde & robbers./*/ And for those swarmes that have not wrought downe within a handfull of the stoole, to the end they may ly warme the winter following, and that they may be ready at the dore to keepe out robbers: at *Virgo/* (for after this time they gather no more wax to enlarge their

$*Of the hives/*/$

\*v.c./*6*n./*13/ combs. *v./*) take so much hay or straw, as wil fill the empty part of the hive within an inch or two of the combes: and wrapping the same in some old linnen cloth, so that the strawes may not offend the Bees, set it upon the stoole: and then having laid thereon a thinne round bord as broad as may easily go into the hive, set the hive over it downe to the stoole: and make a little new dore through the hive betweene the round bord and the combes: or else leave away from the new bottom downe to the old dore, through halfe a greate cane or some other stick cut holow for the nonce, to keepe the stuffing from the side of the hive. Without such help extreame cold wil kill many, & weaken all: whereby they are made unlustie to worke, as the Philosopher well noted. *Si alveus justo amplior sit, desidiodiores redduntur./* \His.l.9.c.40/
\42 *The reared stalles now to be set down againe/*/ The stalls which you reared in the end of *Cancer/* for feare of swarming or killing their yong are to be set downe againe, *v./* \*v.n./*21/ unlesse they be swarmes or yearelings that have wrought downe to the stoole: for after the second sommer wel: they may build new combs, but they will never enlarge the old.
\43 *In Virgo try whether the Bees will live/*/ Also in this month about the middle those hives which you deeme to be weake because the Bees are gon up from the dore, knock with your hand, one after another: they that at the first or second stroke doe make a great noise [cw: both]

===

$*and the dressing of them./*/$ 

both above and beneath continuing the same for a space, have store of Bees, and are therefore in lesse danger: but those that make a litle short noise, though they be heavy and have hony enough (such as are commonly those of three yeere old, and upward that have cast twice or oftner that yeare, and did not at *Virgo/* beare away their drones) yet have they but few Bees, and are therefore ill able to resist the violent multitude of robbers; which, when they perceive their weaknesse wil never leave them as long as there is a drop of hony in the hive.
If you see them once fighting, *v/* \*v.c./*7.*n/*31./ either presently take them, or make their entrance so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once: & before *Libra/* be sure to take them. For though they escape this robbing-time through your care and diligence, yet at the spring they will surely yeeld, or dy of themselves, or fly away. But those stalls that are very full will make little or no noise when you knock them, untl toward the end of this month, when they be gon up from the dore. 
\44 LIBRA/ Some Bees begin to faile after *Virgo/*: and therefore it is good to make triall of them by poising and knocking the hives, and by looking into them (if need bee) in *Libra/* also, \45 *Try them againe in Libra, &c./*/and likewise in *Pisces/* and *Aries/*. But whensoever for this purpose, or upon any other occasion you lift a hive from his stoole, (which is spare- [cw:ing]

\46 *Now set up the porches to the best & keepe them all shut till the Bees offer to go abroad/*/ At *Libra/* set up the porches of the best: and then diligently in the evninges shut the porch dores of al. For in the cold mornings, while the true Bees keepe in, because it is no fit time for them to gather in; in the eves both waspes & Bees will be abroad seeking where they may breake in and steale *v.c./*7*n./*26.

Neverthelesse, the first fowle and colde wether in *Capricorne/* shut the porch dore, to save them from the cold as well within the hive as without. \53 *The first sharp weather in Capr. shut the Bees in./*/ For as the frost and snow and colde windes, yea and the ordinary disposition of the aire doth chil many of them, whom the flattering sunshine enticeth abroad, so the great frosts striking through the dore doe freeze the nethermost in the hive to death: so that little & little many stals in some winters have been therby wholly destroied, the which by keeping them warme might have beene preserved. But when you shut them in, be sure the hives bee alwaies close and sure: \54 *And in pleasant weather let them loose, if it may bee once a fortnight or 3 weekes./*/ for the Bees will strive by all meanes to come forth, though they never finde the way in againe. Yet whensoever in these three months there happen any pleasant day (namely when the sunne shineth, the winde is stil, or bloweth mildly out of the south or west, & the earth is without frost and snow) is it is very behoveful to give them leave to play, *v./* \*v c./*1.*n./*57./ and to refresh themselves: the oftner the better: once in a fortnight or three weekes is to be wished but [cw: if]

if you or the wether shut them in much longer, they wil bee so faint and feeble through their long restraint, that without very pleasant weather at their comming abroad, a number of them wil bee chilled while they rest themselves but a little in the open aire. And therefore as often as any pleasant day causeth you to set the hives open, let them alwaies so stand until the frost or snow keepe the Bees in againe. And after Saint Pauls day or mid-*aquarius/* shut them not, unles the snow lie, or the frost hold two or three daies togither. And if the faire wether, that let them out, continue, so that they use daily to play abroad; you may nowe also clense the stooles, which otherwise is not to bee done before *Pisces/*

This cleansing of the stooles, after a calme *Aquarius/*, when the Bees have beene much abroad, is not so necessarie, and specially for the better stalles.

##CHAP. 4./##

\1 *The drone no labourer/*/{T}HE Drone, which is a grosse hive-bee without sting, hath been alwaies reputed for a sluggard, & that worthily: for howsoever he brave it with his round velvet cappe, his side gown, his great paunch, and his lowd voice: yet is he but an idle person living by the sweat of others brows. For he worketh not at al, ether at home or abroad, and yet spendeth as much as two labourers: you shal never find his maw without a good drop of the purest *nectar/*. In the heat of the day he flieth abroad, aloft, and about, and that with no small noise, as though he would doe some great act: but it is only for his pleasure, and to get him a stomach, and then returneth hee presently to his cheere. *Fuci cum exeunt efferunt sese fusium in sublimi gyroque volitant; quod ubi satis jam fecerint redeunt domum & epulis perfruuntur./* \Hist.li.9.c.40./ But for all this there is necessary use of him, that hee may not be spared, as without whom the Bee cannot be, For albeit be be not seen to ingender [cw:with]

with the hony-bee, *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*50./ ether abroad, as other *insecta/* do, or within the hive, where yet you may by means behold what they do; *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n/*4.&5./ yet without doubte is hee the male-bee, by whose natural heat and masculine vertue the hony-bee, which breedeth both hony-bees & drones, *v./* \*v.n/*11.*&/*16/ secretly conceiveth. 
\3 *Divers reasons proving the drone to be the male. The first reason is, that they are suffered in breeding time only/*/ The reasons that moove me thus to thinke are these. First because although they be great wasters of the Bees store, yet until they begin to leave breeding, and have conceived for the next yeare, (which some do about *Leo/*, most before *Virgo/*) they suffer them afterward they begin to beat them away. Which if some few doe not, before *Scorpio/* they die naturally: and from thenceforth al the winter, until the Bees breed new againe, *v./* \*v.n./*16.&17./ there is not a drone to be had *In rerum natura/*. \Nat hist l.11. c 11./ \4 *No drone in winter./*/ When they are quite gone, then do the Bees lay no more seeds that yeere, but only hatch and breed up those that are already in the celles.
\5.*The second reason is that the drone being taken away in breeding time the Bees breed no more/*/ Secondly, as the rather and the more the drones are, the more & greater are the swarms, (*Corte quo major fuerit fucorum multitudo, eo major fiet examinum proventus v/*) \*v.c./*5 *n/*4./ so where the drones are few & late,there is smal increase & therefore if you kill the drones of a hive before the Bees have done swarming, and breeding (as some fondly have don before Midsomer, to save their hony from these greedy lur- [cw:chers]

$*and of the drone/*/$

chers) neither will the swarmes come forth that were formerly bred, nor the stocke thence forth breed any more. After which time bringing in *Ambrosia v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*17./ as much as before, and having no yong ones to spend part of it, nor taking any pleasure to worke it with the liquid *nectar/*, as otherwise they use to doe, *v/* \*v.c./*6.*n./*17/ they lay it up carelesly in their cells, where it corrupteth & turneth to stopping *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n/*18. & 19./ which will cause them so much to mislike their hive, that the next *Virgo/* they will easily yeeld it to the robbers *v./* \*V.c./*7*n/*23/ And if by your industry they be then preserved, in *Pisces/* when breeding time is, finding themselves barren, and therefore loathing even themselves and all, they yeeld their goods to them that wil take it: & after a while, when the strange Bees and they smel all alike by being togither in the same hive, & sucking the same hony, away they goe with them to their drones. But every faire day they will returne to fetch that they left behind them : you may see them flying so thicke to and fro that hive, as if it were full of Bees: but when night comes, they are all gone. 
\6. *The third reason is that they are bred by the Bees/*/ Thirdly because *omne simile generat sibi simile/* Every living thing doth breed male, or female of his kind, and experience doth teach us that the Bees doe breed as well drones as honi bees *v./* \*v.n./*16/ seeing the honi-bees are femals, it followeth necessarily that the drones are the males of the [cw:same] 
 
===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$

\Hæc apis [greek and hebrew]/ same kind. And therefore not only in the Greek and Latine, but also in the first language, wherein names were given to things according to their natures, the honi-bee hath hir feminine appellation, as the drone his masculine. 
\7 *The fourth reason is that the wasp & dorres have drones which are their males/*/ Fourthly wee see the like in the likest *insecta/* the waspe and the dorre: for the manifesting whereof I wil briefly shew you the breeding of them both. 
\8 *The breeding of wasps by drones/*/ The wasps nest is begun by one great wasp which you may therfore cal the mother-wasp: the which in *Cancer/* (or in hote and dry springs somewhat rather) within some hoale, usuallie made in the ground by a Moule, Mouse, or other meanes, worketh a combe, in forme of a round tent hanging by the top to the over part of the hoale. This combe containeth about six celles of the bignes & fashion of the Bees cells, wherein shee breedeth so many young ones: which, when they are fledge, do breed as well as their dam: and so enlarge the combe to some eight inches over. Then making more roome beneath by moining & carrying out the earth, they hang an other combe under the first, by little pins, and so an other, and an other, increasing stil in the same place til sommer bee done. For they goe not forth in swarmes as Bees doe. \His l.9.c.42/ *Missio ut apum nulla vel crabronum vel vesparum fieri solet: sed qui subinde oriantur novelli ibidem ma/* [cw:*nent/*] 

===

$*and of the Drone./*/$
*nent, & alveum terra egestæ faciunt ampliorem./* In their last brood, which is in *Scorpio/*, besides the smal or ordinary waspes, they have also two other sorts, drones or male-waspes (which are somewhat bigger then the smal wasps, & without stings as the drone Bees) & mother wasps, which are like the smal ones in al respectes save that they are twise so bigge. These when they are fledge having conceived, as the Bees, by the drones, leaving both drones and smal waspes to the mercy of the winter (which with the next cold-wet wether chilleth and killeth them as they flie abroad) do forthwith betake themselves to some warme place, as the thatch of an house, a mortice in a post, an auger-hoale, or the like: where they abide til the next spring without any meate, as it were in a dead sleepe: out of the which neverthelesse a little warmth of the fire, or of your hande will awake them at anie time. At the blowing of a palme, if the weather be warme, they fly abroad for food: and at *Cancer/*, as I have said, they begin to nestle and breede. He that killeth one of them killeth a whole nest of waspes. 
And that the drone-waspes are the males, some were of opinion in the daies of *Aristotle/* for thus he writeth. \His.li.9.41./ *Si vespam ex pedibus ceperis bombilareque, siveris, advolant quæ aculeo carent, quod non faciunt, quæ aculeatæ sunt. Itaque argumento quidam hoc utuntur quod alteræ mares sunt, alteræ fœ-/* [cw:*minæ/*]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$

*minæ/* which argument seemeth not unprobable, seeing the fowlers counterfeiting the cal of the hen-quailes catch only the cockes.
\9.*The breeding of Dorrs by drones./*/ The dorre likewise beginneth hir neast single, being more like the Bee then the wasp is in that she maketh hony, and more unlike in the fashion of her combs: for she hath only a few round cells of the bignesse of grapes lying flat on the ground one upon another without any order: the which are made after this maner. First ether upon the ground in the grasse, or in some shallow hoale within the ground, she prepareth a little stuffe which is soft like wax, but browne and more brittle, of the bignesse of hir head; & therein she layeth about six or seaven seedes together compassing them round with the same stuffe: which increaseth by little and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to live, it groweth into so many severall cells, as there are grubs, each one having one to himselfe. When they become to their bignes, the celles, which before were browne and brittle, do now wax white and tough that you can scarce teare them. And when the dorres are ripe they gnaw their way out at the toppe. Upon these they make more in like manner, and the voide open celles they fil with hony, wherewith they feede both themselves and their yong when the weather suffreth them not to flie abroad. All this neast is covered with a little mosse like a birds-neast. [cw: Until]

$*and of the drone./*/$

Untill *Virgo/* they breede females only as the waspes doe and then last of all for propagation of their kinde they breed their drones, being likewise, as the drones of Bees & waspes, without stings. And these, to put the matter out of doubt, within a while after do openly engender with their females, as the chaffers doe. After which time the females breed no more till the next sommer, though you may see them gathering, and flying about somewhat longer then the waspes. In *Saggit/*: they betake themselves to their winter-rest, where they lie single as the mother waspe in a sleepe or swivet. But the drone-dorres, as the drone wasps, are destroied by the wether: not one afterwarde to be seene till *Virgo/*, when the females breed new againe. But one thing in the dorres & waspes is more strange then in the Bees. For whereas the Bees assone as they have bred their first broode of females, doe presently breede drones, *v./* \*v.n./*16/ both which, when they are ripe multiply togither; the young dorres and waspes in the beginning of sommer do not immediately take the drones (for then there are none) but receive from their da?s togither with their nature & being that masculine seed, wherby when they are ripe they breed likewise conceive by their late-bred drones for the next yeare, both for themselves and the yong that shal come of them.

\10 *The fift reason is the apparent signes of their sex./*/ By this time thou wilt say with me, that the drone is the male-bee: Whereof if some curious chirurgion would make an anotomy, he should easily discerne *duos amplos & candidos testes/*, two sufficient witnesses of his masculine sex.
The light of this truth began to appeare many yeares agoe, even in Aristotles time. *Aliqui/* (saith he) *mares esse fucos, fœminas vero apes esse contendunt./* Which opinion he reciteth in another place. *Sunt qui fucos mares esse, apes fœminas arbitrentur/*. \His l.5.c.21/ Where though he doe not approve it, yet hath he no other reason against it but this. *Arma ad pugnam viresque exercendas nulli famina anatur atribunutur./* Nature hath armed the Bees to chastice the drones, *v./* \*v.n./*20/ and therefore the drones cannot be their males. 
The weaknesse of which reason I marvaile he did not see, seeing in all the kind of hawkes the female doth command the male, as being both stronger and better armed. Whereunto may be added the example of the *Amazons/* raigning in his time: who by force of arms subdued many kingdomes of men, and held them in subjection: like unto which, it is marvaile but there were then some masterful viragoes in Greece, as wel as there be now in other countries. But of this point in the end of the same Chap: hee yeeldeth himselfe to have no certaine knowledge. *Non tamen satis adhue ex-/* [cw:*plorata/*]

\11 *When the Bees begin to breed/*/ To returne therefore to our purpose, the hony-bees having, as those other *insecta/*, conceived by the drones; the best about *Pisces/* when they first gather upon flowers, others in *Aries,/* and the weaker later, begin to breed their femals thus.
\12 *The manner of their breeding/*/First close under the hony (which is that time altogether in the upper parts of the combs) in the middle of the bottomes of the void cels as the waspes doe on one side, they begin to lay their seedes, about the bignes of those which the butterfly leaves upon the cabage leaves: but of different colour, the Bees being white like wasp seeds, and the butterflies yellow. And so they descend by degrees toward the nether part of the combes filling one cell after an other. Although when the chiefe breeding is past, they doe not precisely observe this order, but lay up their hony among the yong Bees where they find the cells void. \13 *The Bee seed is first turned into a worme./*/ The Bee-seed at the first sticketh upon one ende until it be a live worme or grub: as soone as it liveth it is loose, and lieth in the bottome of the cell round like a ring, one end touching the other, till so the bottome can no longer conteine it: after that, it lieth along in the cel til it be growen to the full bignesse of a Bee: and then doth the worme die and becommeth void of al motion and sense, and so is shut up in the cell, the [cw: Bees] 

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees/*/$
Bees covering the top close with wax. 
\14 *The worme being dead groweth to the shape of a Bee and then liveth againe./*/ The worme thus lying dead doth by little and little grow to the shape of a Bee, but of colour white as before: and having obtained the full proportion, then doth it first begin to move againe, and to live hir second life: and thence forth by little & little turneth browne. Before she is perfectly browne, she flieth abroad practising to worke: and all this within the space of a month. 
\Hist.an.l.5.c.22./ *Foetu posito incubant, exclusus inde vermiculus, dum parvus est, iacet in favo obliquus: postea sua apse facultate se erigit, cibumque capit. Foetus apum & fucorum candidus est:ex quo vermiculi fiunt, qui in apes fucosque transeant./*

manner in wider cells made for the nonce *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*8./ they breed the male-bees or drones: as was long since observed, *Sunt fuci sine aculeo velut imperfectæ apes, novissimequam a fessis & jam emeritis inchoatæ, serotinus fœtus./* \7 *When they come abroad/*/ And therefore some stalls doe not drony before *Cancer/*, not many before *Gemini/*, nor any before *Taurus/*; although you may see the +Nymphs of good stals abroad in *Aries/*, of others in *Taurus/*, and of all in *Gemini/*. By chance some few Cephens may be bred betime with the femals: but they, as comming out of season, are not suffered to live. 
+The yong Bees are called schadons: *schadones sobolem dico./* Hist l.5 c.22. The brood of femals, when they have the shape of Bees, are first called Nymphs, and the yong drones Cephens: *Cætera turba cum formam capere cæpis Nymphæ vocantur ut fuci cephenes/* Pl.li.11.c.11.
\18 *Two uses of the drones./*/ These Cephens or drones, when they are fledge, doe not only serve for generation as hath beene shewed, but also doe helpe the femals much, by reason of their great heate, in hatching their broods. *In fœtu adiuvant apes, multum ad calorem conferente turba./* \Pl.l.11.c.11/ \19 *Where they ly/*/ And for these causes they are alwaies in breeding time mingled with them throughout the hive. Although afterward  (when they have beene much beaten, and can goe no where single, but one or other will be on their jacks) they gather altogether in a cluster, for their safty in one side of the hive: so that it is true at some time which the Philosopher spake indefinitely, *Tenent alves locum peniti/* [cw: *orem/*]

*orem/*. And yet their hanging together will not serve their turne: for the Bees, when they are disposed, will quickly make them part, and depart. When there is no use of them, there will be no roome for them.
\20 *The male bees are subject to the females./*/ For the drones are but vassales to the hony-bees, which as they doe excell them in virtue and goodnesse, so doe they also in power and authoritie, ruling and over-ruling them at their pleasures. \Nat:hist,1.11.c.11./ *Sunt quasi servitia verarum apus quamobrem imperant ijs./* For albeit generally among al creatures the males, as more worthy, doe master the femals; yet in these the femals have the preeminence: and by the Gramarians leave the feminine gender is more worthy then the masculine, *hæc apes/* then *hic fucus, hæc Nympha/* then *hic Cephen./* But let no nimble tonged Sophisters gather a false conclusion from these true premisses, that they by the example of these may arrogat to themselves the like superioritie: for *Ex particulare non est syllogizare,/* & he that made these to command their males, commanded them to be commanded. But if they would so fain to have it so, let them first imitate their singular virtues, their continuall industry in gathering, their diligent watchfulnes in keeping, their chastitie, cleanlinesse, and discreete œconomie, &c. And then, if they meete with such idle dotrels as these drones are, they may with lesse blame borrow a point of the law [cw: and]

Yet this they may note by the way, that albeit the females in this kinde have the soveraignty, yet have the males the lowder voice, as it is in other living things, doves, owsils, thrushes, &c: the males being knowne by their sounding and shril notes from the silent females. Yea the wives themselves wil not suffer that hen to live, which presumeth to crow as the cock doth: nature teaching that silence, and soft noise becommeth that sex.
