For seeing it is knowne that a Blacke-smith of <inline font-style="normal" font-weight="normal">London</inline> did make a Locke and a Key so little that a flye could draw it; why should not the little Smith of <inline font-style="normal" font-weight="normal">Nottingham</inline>, which doth the worke that no man can, frame a little Chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they will reply, if wee grant you this, yet how could the Bees flie about the altar in that little Chappell, seeing they are scarce able flie in so narrow a close roome as the emptie hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: haply the woman said they did but crawle. If they shall aske how the woman could see the altar with the Host standing in the Chancell, and the Bells hanging in the steeple, seeing the waxen walls were not transparent, they maie easily thinke that the Bees would give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if they shall say that those bells being made of such metall would give but a weake sounde, when they were rung to Mattins; they must consider the Parishoners dwelt not farre off.

Some give them Honie in a spoone: but that way many of them be-smeare their wings: and if their fellowes licke them not cleane presently, before the cold chill them, they die. Others, to avoid this inconvenience, give it them in a warme Toste: but this way wasteth the hony, &amp; doth not altogether avoid the former inconvenience. Others have other devices. But indeed the only good way to feed Bees is with a combe, after this manner. First, take a fresh Combe of Live-honie out of a Hive, &amp; lay it upon some Prop or stay, that the Bees may worke, as well under as upon. This Prop may be a woodden grate seven or eight inches square, made of two sides halfe an inch deepe, and three ribs fastened into them with Dove-railes, or with small nailes.
