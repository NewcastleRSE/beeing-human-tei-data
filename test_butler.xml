                    stocks having bred and filled their hives do send forth swarms. A swarme doth
                    consist of al such partes as the stocke doth, namely of a queene-bee, hony-bees
                    as wel old as yong, and drone bees. </p>
                <p><note type="authorial" subtype="summary">2. When you may see the queene-bee.</note>
                    If any man desire to see the queene, he hath now opportunity, when she goeth
                    forth with her swarme: *v.n./*27 and dead ones he may find many before the
                    stooles when the stocks have cast their last swarmes, *v.n./*29. and also when
                    many meete in one swarme, *v.c./*1.*n/*7.</p>
                <p><note type="authorial" subtype="summary">2 The swarme no younger then the stocke.</note>
                    Men thinke that the swarme consisteth only of yong Bees, and that the old Bees
                    only tary behinde: but indeed (though it may seeme strange) the swarme is no
                    younger, then the stocke: for there are in both of both sortes. The yong Bees
                    remaine in the stock with the old for their defence and for the greatest
                    labours, *v./* *V.c./*I.*n/ *55./&amp; the old ones go with the yonge in the
                    swarme for their aid and guidance in their worke. </p>

                    signe./*/ And therefore those swarmes that have many drones wil surely prosper:
                    and if they be rathe wil swarme againe, unlesse they bee over-hived: whereas
                    those that have fewe or none, will increase little or nothing all the sommer
                    after. </p>
                <p>\5 *A kinde spring for swarmes./* A warme, calme, and showring spring causeth
                    many &amp; rathe swarmes: whereas dry, windy, and cold-stormy wether doth then
                    worke contrary effects. For it both hindereth the breeding, because the old Bees
                    at such times wil go little abroad, and when they do, they find smal state in
                    the flowers; and also destroyeth the breed, because the tender fry adventuring
                    into the ungentle aire, are so beaten &amp; chilled upon a sodaine, that few are
                    able to recover the hive. </p>

                <p>\6 *Swarming wether/*/ Likewise in warme and calme weather the swarmes delighte
                    to arise, but specially in a gloome after a showre; in extreme hot and dry
                    wether not so: *v/* \*V.n./*19./ in so much that stals being ful and ready to
                    swarme with the first, are somtime so kept backe with cold dry windes in
                    *Gemini,/* and with extreme heat &amp; drought in *Cancer,/* that they have not
                    swarmed at al that yeere.</p>
                <p>\7 *The swarming howres/*/The swarmes use to come forth betweene the howres of
                    nine and three, but chieflie betweene eleven and one. They choose rather the
