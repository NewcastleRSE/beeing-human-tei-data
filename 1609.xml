                    the excellencie of the nature of Bees, saith thus, <hi>Inter omnia insecta
                        principatus apibus et jure praecipua admiratio; solis ex eo genere hominum
                        causam genitis</hi>. Of all <hi>insecta</hi> the Bees are chiefe, and
                    worthily to bee most admired; beeing the only thinges of that kinde, which are
                    bred for the behoofe of men. The later part of which saying although the delicat
                    Silk-worme have else-where disproved, and is now setting foot in this land, here
                    also to except against it; yet must shee needs confesse the former, and, when
                    shee is come, yeelde the precedence to the laborious Bee, as to hir elder
                    sister; which as in time, so in vertue is before her. For the fruite of the
                    Silke-worme serveth onlie to cover the bodie; but the fruite of the Bee to
                    nourish and cure it: that is to bee applied outwardly, this to be inwardly
                    received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health &amp; necessitie.
                    But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bees is so great and

                    </note> they were pleased to spend most of their time in this pleasing busines.

                        desertis apes colentem Agrium cognominatum: qui ambo scripsere de
                        iis</hi>.<hi>Aristotle</hi> thought his <hi>Historia animalium</hi>
                    unperfect, unles he had inserted a tract of the nature of Bees: of which hee
                    discourseth more at large, than he doth of any other living creature.
                        <hi>Plinie</hi> likewise in his <hi>Naturalis historia</hi> is very copious
                    in this argument. Besides whom, divers other have written therof: as
                        <hi>Columella, Varro, Palladius, Averroes</hi>. Yea the learned and grave
                    fathers of the Church <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Isidore</hi> have thought it a
                    subject fit for their pens. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later times
                    both in Latine &amp; English; which have written many things of these admirable
                    creatures. </p>
                <p xml:id="frontpar3">But in al their writings they seeme unto me to say little out
                    of experience, and to rely more upon the relation of others; than anie certaine

                        <hi>Aristotle &amp; Plinie</hi>, are scatered many true and good
                    observations; which, being found agreeable to experience, I have here and there,
                    as occasion required, for authority and ornament interlaced. But the later
                    writers, imitating the ancient where they thought good, choosing some of their
                    directions and refusing others, doe, for the most part, unluckely light upon the
                    worse: so that, being compared, they are no way matchable unto them; whome by the
                    advantage of time they might haue surpassed. Among which <hi>Georgius
                        Pictorius</hi> a learned Physitian deserveth best, as having taken most
                    paines in perusing the ancient authors, and gathering their matter into his
                    methode. Whom one <hi>T. H.</hi> of London translating word for word into
                    English as wel as he could, concealing the authors name, adventured to publish
                    in his owne name. These and the like when a scholar hath throughly read, he
                    thinketh himselfe throughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth
                    abroad to put his skil in practise, every silie woman is ready to deride his
                    learned ignorance.</p>
                <p xml:id="frontpar4">Wherefore considering howe greate the vertue and efficacy of
                    the fruite of these <note>v.c.10.p.3</note> creatures is, both for the
                    preserving, and restoring of mans health, I thought it not amisse to spend some

                    my contentment, though to my cost, in some sort attained my desire, I was
                    incited, even by the rule of charity, to communicate that to my neighbours &amp;
                    countrymen, which I have found so beneficiall to my selfe: so that the reader

                    I see how they can be, seeing the swarmes of tame Bees doe often fly into trees,
                    &amp; so become wilde: and the swarmes of wild Bees are not seldome found, and
                    put into hives. Indeed the wild are more angry than the tame: but that is
                    because they are lesse used to the companie of men. Moreover there is some
                    difference in the bignesse of Bees. For they that are loaded seeme greater and
                    longer than those that are leere: also the Nymphs <hi>v</hi>

                    her hir desired profit, but did consume &amp; die of the murraine; made her mone to
                    another woman more simple than hir selfe: who gave her councel to get a

                    went to the priest to receive the host: which when she had done, she kept it in
                    hir mouth, &amp; being come home againe she tooke it out and <fw type="catch">

                    abounded. The woman therefore lifting up the hive at the due time to take out
                    the honie, sawe there (most strange to be seene) a chappel built by the Bees
                    with an altar in it, the wals adorned by marvelous skil of architecture with
                    windowes conveniently set in their places: also a dore and a steeple with bels.
                    And the host being laid upon the altar, the bees making a sweet noise flew round
                    about it*. <note><anchor xml:id="ch1ancs18"/>*Tho.Bozius de signis

                    to answere. First it may be they wil object that the host being held so
                    long in the womans mouth could not choose in that space but melt and marre.
                    Indeed, if it did remaine, as it was, a wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but
                    being turned into flesh <anchor xml:id="ch1ancs20"/>it is an absurd

                    now honi-harvest, at which time good stals, such as this was, are ful of wax and

                    it; I answere that this is as weake and simple as the former. For seeing it is
                    knowne that a blacke smith of London did make a locke and key so little that a
                    flie could draw it; why shoulde not the little smith of Nottingham <anchor

                        xml:id="ch1ance21"/> frame a little chappell in a litle roome? But then
                    perhaps they wil reply, if we grant you this, howe then could the Bees flie
                    about the altar in that little chappel, seeing they are <anchor
                        xml:id="ch1ancs22"/>not<anchor xml:id="ch1ance22"/> able to flie in so
                    narrow a roome as the empty hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word:
                    happily the woman said they did but crawle. If they shal aske how the woman
                    could see the altar with the host standing in the chancel &amp; the bels hanging
                    in the steeple, seeing the waxen wals were not transparent, they maie easilie
                    thinke that the Bees woulde give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes.
                    And if they shal say that those bels being made of such metall would give but a
                    weake sounde when they were runge to matins; they must consider the parishoners
                    dwelt not far of. And so I thinke these captious criticks wil hold themselves
                    satisfied. </p>
                <p xml:id="ch1par30">Unto this storie my author immediately addeth an other, like
                    unto it, and as likely: how certaine theeves having stollen the silver boxe

                    </fw> one of them there, being loath, belike, that he should lie abroad all
                    night, did not cast him away, but laid him under a hive: whom the Bees
                    acknowledging advanced to an high roome in the hive, and there in steede of his
                    silver boxe made him an other of the whitest wax: &amp; when they had so done, in
                    worshippe of him, at set howres they sung most sweetly beyond al measure about
                    it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight with a light and al. Wherewith
                    the bishop being made acquainted, came thither with many others: &amp; lifting
                    up the hive he saw there neere the top a most fine box, wherein the host was
                    laid, and the quires of Bees singing about it, and keeping watch in the night,
                    as Monkes do in their cloisters. The bishop therfore taking the host caried it
                    with the greatest honour into the church: whether many resorting were cured of
                    innumerable diseases. </p>

                    as wel as the former, making question since the combs in the top of the hive are
                    not past halfe an inch one from an other, how there could bee roome for a box of
                    that breadth that would containe the host, &amp; then being there, how it might
                    be seene by the Bishoppe, seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees, and
                    the story saith that they were then singing about it: and therefore perhaps they
                    wil suspect the whole narration, supposing <fw type="catch">it</fw>

                    consulted with them that have skil among Bees, might have made his tale more
                    probable. Alleadging moreover that therefore there is no mention made of my
                    particular person, time, or place, least the circumstances should disprove the
                    matter it selfe. All which objections I could as easily answere as the former,
                    if I thought it needful. But now because some may bee as ready to mistrust my

                    then the wasp is in that she maketh hony, and more unlike in the fashion of her
                    combs: for she hath only a few round cells of the bignesse of grapes lying flat
                    on the ground one upon another without any order: the which are made after this
                    maner. First ether upon the ground in the grasse, or in some shallow hoale
                    within the ground, she prepareth a little stuffe which is soft like wax, but
                    browne and more brittle, of the bignesse of hir head; &amp; therein she layeth
                    about six or seaven seedes together compassing them round with the same stuffe:
                    which increaseth by little and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to
                    live, it groweth into so many severall cells, as there are grubs, each one
                    having one to himselfe. When they become to their bignes, the celles, which
                    before were browne and brittle, do now wax white and tough that you can scarce
                    teare them. And when the dorres are ripe they gnaw their way out at the toppe.
                    Upon these they make more in like manner, and the voide open celles they fil
                    with hony, wherewith they feede both themselves and their yong when the weather

                    slipt downe into a great holow tree, and there sunk into a lake of hony up to
                    the brest: where when he had stucke fast two daies calling and crying out in

                    the top of the tree, &amp; thence began to let himselfe downe backward into it.

                    through age or wet, or with abundance of noisome stopping; wil most of them goe
                    forth in the swarmes, leaving a very few, sometime not past a handful in the
                    stocke: which yet in robbing-time wil keep the dore, as though the hive were
                    full: but the robbers finding their weaknes wil surely spoile them, if they be

                    then either warme it first in a pot over the fire, or else spread it all over

                        shal receive much benefit by it, against quartan agues, against cacexies,

                            impleaded in the spirituall court for the tithes of the said wood,
                            whereby the owners cannot sell their woods to the very valew, to the

                        statute giveth way to none of al these evils. For first, there is no mention
                        at al in these words of any immunity or discharge of tithe: unles they wil
                        say that wheresoever a prohibition is granted in a cause of tith, there he
                        that sueth for tith must loose it: which, albeit the modern practise make it
                        seeme probable, yet wil they not say that it is perpetual. But bee it so.
                        Yet how doth this concerne the lops of trees which are cut from the standing
                        stems, and serve not for timber but for fuel? Nay where are the trees
                        themselves, as now they are used, freed from tith? It is ordained byt his
                        law, that <hi>wheras great wood is sold to merchants for the owners profit,
                            or in aide of the king in his warres, &amp;c. in this case a prohibition

                        the increase of them with so little cost &amp; care. But even in this case,
                        where the bodies were discharged of tith, because they were sold to the

                        also pay the tith which it yeeldeth <hi>in specie</hi> during the same time.
                        True: for how should we blame them that pay lesse then the tith, if we would
                        recieve more then the tithe, sith both are alike unjust. But the

                        forbidding the payment of tithe, as being made purposely in favour of the
