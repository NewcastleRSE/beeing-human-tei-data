##*Of the Bees Enemies./*/##

\1 *The Bees Enemies are many./*/
{T}He good Bee, as other good things, hath many Enemies, from which she needeth your helpe to defend her: namely, 1.the Mouse, 2.the Wood-pecker, 3.the Tit-mouse, 4.the Swalow, 5.the Hornet, 6.the Waspe, 7.the Moth, 8.the Snaile, 9.the Emet 10.the Spider, 11.the Toad, 12.the Frog, 13.the Bee, and 14.the Weather.
\2. *The Mouse./*/ The Mouse, whether he be of the field or of the house, is a dangerous Enemie. For if he get into a Hive, he teareth downe the Combes, makes havocke of the Honie, and so starves the Bees. Some enter by the doore, or by some open place in the skirts of the Hive: some gnaw a hole throrow in the top of the Hive, where they know the Honie lieth. Some keepe their old homes, and come to the Hive onely for their baits: some make their nests betweene the Hackle and the Hive, that they may the sooner, and the safer come to the Honie at their pleasure. 
\3. *Remedies against the Mouse./*/ For remedie, first you must looke that your Hives, whether they be of straw or wicker, be close and fast wrought. For if the straw be loose and soft, they will more easily gnaw their way thorow: and if the wicker be thinne, when they have torne down the cloome, they will creepe in betweene the twigges. Next see that the Hives bee daubed close round about the skirts, that there be no entring but by the Doore: which in the end of *Taurus,/* when the Bees come downe to watch, and thenceforth all the Summer, they will keepe well enough both day and night: but all the Winter, at which time the Mise make most spoile, it must bee made so narrow, that they cannot get in. *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*31./ Also it behoveth you to remove all things about your Hives, that may hide and harbour them, *v./* for they will feare

to come and goe in sight, lest the Cat meet with them by the way. Moreover, it is good now and then, in drie and warme daies, to take off the hackles, as well for this as for other causes. *v./* \*V.c.5.n.23./*/ Those that neastle upon the top of the Hive, when the hackle is taken of, will sit still amazed so long, that you may be sure to crush them against the Hive with your hand. Lastly, you shall doe well to set baited+ traps in their way, that so they may come short. 
\*A Samsons post./*/ There is none bettwe than a Sampsons Post: which is a flat Cover or Roofe supported by a triangular Pillar or Prop, whose three sides doe so hold one by another, through the weight of the Roofe, that the loosing of one is the loosing of all: and so the Prop failing the Roofe falleth. 
\*The Roofe./*/ The Roofe may bee a Plankes or Boords end, or the like, twelve inches long and ten broad: which of it selfe, or with some advantage weigheth foure or five pound. 
\*The parts of the Prop./*/ The three sides or parts of the Prop (namely, the Post, the Sweeke, and the Brace) are three sticks, all almost halfe an inch broad, and halfe a quarter of an inch thicke. 
\*The Post./*/ The Post is moreover three inches and a halfe long, and sharpned at one end. 
\*The Brace./*/ The Brace likewise three inches and a halfe long, and sharpe at one end; with a nicke on the broad side halfe an inch within the other end.
\*The Sweeke./*/ And the Sweeke eight inches long, with a nicke on the upper broad side a little within the out-end; and another on the left edge, two inches and the thickness of the Post within the broad nicke.  
\*The framing of the Prop./*/ The parts of the Prop being thus formed apart, are to be framed together in a triangle, after this manner. First, take the Brace in your left hand and beare up the fore-side of the Roofe with the blunt end, the nicke being inward: then set up the Post somewhat leaning toward you, with his sharpe end in the nicke of the Brace: then hooke the edge-nicke of the Sweeke to the Post: and make all fast with the sharpe edge of the Brace fixed in the broad nicke of the Sweeke.   
\*The baiting of the Sweeke./*/ But first bait the Sweeke with the thinne peece of good Cheese, or Bacon, or Suet, tyed with a thread upon the inner end. And bee sure that the Prop doe stand so sickle that it may easily be loosed: and that the Roofe when it falleth, lie flat and even with the Floore, lest the poore Mouse lose hir labour.

\4.*The Wood-pecker./*/ The Wood-pecker or Yippingale, if hee finde any hoale in the Hive against the Honie, doth with his long round tongue draw it out: but he doth more harme to Wood-Bees then Garden-Bees.
\5. *The Tit-mouse./*/ Of Titmise, there are three sorts. The great Titmouse (which of his colly head and breast some call a Colemouse) is a very harmefull Bird. For although sometime hee seeme content with dead Bees, yet is hee a great devourer of the quicke also. \6. *The subtill practice of the Tit-mouse./*/ In winter he taketh them at the Hive as they come forth: when the cold makes them keepe in, hee will stand at the doore, and there never leave knocking till one come to see who is there: and then suddenly catching her, away he flies with her: and when he hath eaten her, he comes againe for more: eight or nine will scarce serve his turne at once. If the doore be shut that none can come forth, hee labours to remove the Barre: if that be too heavie, he falls to

moining about the doore for a new way: and when these devices cannot get them out; some have the skill to breake the wals of the daubed Hives above, over against the place where they lie: and there they are sure to have their purpose. But in the spring, when the Bees come to the palme, hee standeth there watching for them, and while they are busie at their worke he devoureth many. The little Russet one in Winter feedeth only on dead Bees; but in the Spring he will take part with the great one. The little greene Titmouse I cannot accuse. 
\7. *The Swallow./*/ The Swallow taketh them as they flie, *Populatur hirundo,/* & alibi *Ea demum sola avium non nisi in volatu pascitur/*: \Nat hist.li.II.c.18/ \Nat hist.li.10.cap.24./ But I am perswaded she doth much lesse harme than the Titmouse, although she have a worse name. The Long-winged Hauke makes the fairer flight; but the short-winged is the Kitchen-hauke. These birds therefore are not to be suffered.
*Absint meropesq aliæq volucres 
Et manibus Progne pectus signata cruentis./*
\8. *Remedie against the Titmouse and Swallow./*/ Let boyes destroy their neasts in Summer, and catch the Titmouse in Winter, with+ Traps baited with dead Bees, Oats, or Tallow. *Aristotle/* joyneth the Waspe, the little Titmouse, the Swallow, and the great Titmouse together. \His.l.9.c.40./ *Inferunt injuriam apibus maxime vespæ, & aviculæ quas paros vocant, atque etiam hirundo, & merops qui apiaster est. Quamobrem apiarii vesparum latibula & hirundinum ac meropum nidos propinquos alveis tollunt./*
+As Cage traps, Pit-falls, and Samsons-Posts (*v./* + *in n.3/*) But then set a Lath before the Prop, leaning from the Floore to the Roofe, lest the busie Bird throw it downe for nothing. 
\9. *The Hornet./*/ The Hornet also devoureth Bees: being so much too strong for them, that they can make no resistance. Which the Poet meant where he said 
*Aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis./* 
Hir manner is to fly about before the Hive, till she have spied hir pray settled at the doore, and then suddenly she taketh it in hir feet, and flieth away with it as a Kite with a Chicke.

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

\10. *The Hornets sting is dangerous./*/ In destroying the Hornets you must bee warie: for one stinging doth ofttimes cause a Fever, and lesse than thirtie, as some say, will kill a man. \Nat.hist.li.II.c.21./ *Ictus crabronum baud temere sine febri est. Auctores sunt ter novenis interfici hominem./*
\11. *The Waspe./*/ The Waspe doth much more hurt than the Hornet. For the Hornet now and then killeth a Bee: but the Waspe wasteth the Honie, whereby many whole Stalls doe perish. For besides the harme that she doth hir selfe, she doth ofttimes set the Robber *v./* \*V.n.25./*/ on worke: who, when the Waspe hath begun, will be ready to take part with her, add then all goes to wracke. A Waspe is by nature harder and stronger then a Bee, specially in *Libra/*: insomuch that ofttimes she breaketh from two or three of them, though they have all hold of her at once: and perhaps killeth one of them out of hand. At *Cancer,/* or, the Spring being hot and drie, in the later part of the former moneth, the Waspe beginneth to bee bred: *v./* \*v.c./*4.*n./*8./ within a moneth after shee first appeareth: and in a while she beginneth to feed upon dead and weake Bees: which she quickly cutting of in the middle with hir Fanges, first carrieth away the neather-part; and anon fetcheth the other, when she hath bitten off the winges (for easier carriage) not farre from the place where she took it up. \13 *When she stealeth Honie./*/ Within a moneth after hir comming abroad, shee waxeth bold, and adventureth into the Hives for honie: but, by reason of the strangenesse of hir voice and habit, shee is discried before shee come neere: And at the first (while the weather is warme, and the Bees both early and late keepe watch and ward at the Hives doore) comming single against many, she is commonly repulsed, and sent backe againe with a Flea in hir eare: and if by chance she slip in, she doth not alwaies escape. Sometime she is killed in the Hive, and brought forth dead: and sometime without doore, when she hath got hir prey. But afterwards, the weather waxing cold, and specially in mornings and evenings, and the Bees therefore retiring from the doore higher into the Hive; the Waspes make great spoile, specially among them that are weake. And this they continue untill *Scorpio:/* after which time they begin to weare. \14 *When they weare away./*/ Neverthelesse while they live, that is until
[cw: *Sagittarius/*]

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

*Sagittarius/* (if abundance of cold and wet rid them not a little rather) they wil be filching: & one Waspe will carrie out as much as two Bees bring in. 
\15. *In what yere the Waspes are few./*/ The Winter wet and cold, killeth many of the Mother-Waspes *v./* as they lie in their sleepe. The Spring wet and cold hindereth their breeding: for being by that meanes kept in, when their time is come to flie abroad and feed; they pine and faint, so that either they breed not at all, or verie late. And when a warme fit in the beginning of *Aries/* having let them abroad, cold and stormie weather commeth suddenly upon them; they are shut up againe, and so starve the the most part with hunger and cold: that your Bees shall not be much troubled with them in such a yeere. Yea continuance of wet, though without cold, is such an enemy to the Waspes; that in the yeere 1613, though, the former Summer being exceeding dry, the Waspes were multiplied, and the Winter being milde, the Mother-Waspes were many at first; yet the Rainie Spring and Summer, did so spill their nests, that there were no small Waspes seene till *Libra/*, and then verie few. 
\16. *In what yeere they abound./*/ But the Winter being milde, and the Spring and Summer continuing warme and dry, they live and breed in everie place: that, without continuall and diligent attendance, you shall be sure of great losse among your Bees, though the former yeere there were but few: For one nest yeeldeth breeders enough, if they should all live, to store a whole countrey. 
For these causes, *Ann./* 1611. there were every where such multitudes that the like I thinke was not knowne before in our memorie: insomuch that within two or three Furlongs of my Garden, were killed that Summer abive fiftie great nests: (and yet, by the report to our Bees, wee knew we had not all) besides 22. Mother-Waspes killed in the Spring at our Bee-trough, which would have made so many nests. And 1620. for the same causes the number was as great or greater: and yet the exceeding wet Summer following I saw not one small Waspe. 

\16 *Remedies against the Waspes./*/ Wherefore, if you love your Bees, suffer not a Waspes nest about you. 
The ready way to rid them is, If they be in a Tree above

the hoale, to smother them with Brimstone or Bunt, as you kil Bees. If in the Thatch of an house, (when you have made way to the Combes) to scald them. If in the ground (as most commonly they are) you may likewise scald them, and so take the Combes out whole, and give the Grubs to your Chicken: although the Boyes make better sport in burning them. But if you be in haste, and care onely to dispatch them quickly and quietly, thus doe. First, stop their way close; that they within breake not out upon you (for those that are abroad comming home wearie and loaded are more gentle.) Then presently with a + Waspe-spade search for the Nest: which, if it be shallow, is quickly found. When you have found it (which you shall know by the easie entrance of the Spade) then dig downe round about it: and having thus rounded the Nest, stamp the earth downe upon the Combes, and so have you done. If you finde not the Nest because it lyeth + deepe; then dig up the ground a foot about the hoale; and having found their way, stop it fast with earth, and tread in that you digged out, and let them alone. If this be done in the day when many are abroad; the evening or morning following you may kill them with your foot: but in the evening you may take them all together. 
+Which is a thin Iron one, whose Padle is not above foure inches broad next the Socket, and thence taperd unto three inches at the steeled point, and eight or nine inches long. If it bee broader it is not so apt to enter, and so to finde and round the Nest: and a thicker one is apt to let out the fresh Waspes, that will trouble your worke: but you may make a shift with any ordinarie Spade or Padle-staffe. 
+In Corne-ground the Nest is begunne under a Furrow, and therefore is alwaies shallow: in old laine it is begunne in a Want-hole, and therefore it is sometime shallow, and sometime deepe. 
And to destroy those that resort to your Hives, set by them Sider, Vertjuice, sowre Drinke, or Grounds, in a short necked Violl open, or other Glasse covered with a Paper that hath a hoale in the middle: and so you shall catch many. Also you may take of sweet Apples, or Peares, or beasts Liver, or other flesh, or any thing that they love, foure or five slices or more, and lay them in so many severall places among your Bees:

upon which you shall have sometime as many as will court the Bait, which you may kill at once, as Butchers kill Flies. 
\Hist.li.9.c.40./ *Aristotle/* teacheth you an other way. *Impugnatur/* (saith he) *apes a vespis: quamobrem apiarii eas venantur constituta olla, & carne in ca posita. Ubi enim multæ ad carnem accesserint, apposito operculo super ignem ollam ponunt./* You may also use other meanes to kil them your selfe. How to helpe and defend your Bees against them, see *c./*3.*n./*46,47,54,&55.
\18. *The Moth./*/ The flying Moth lyeth betweene the Hacle and the Hive, and breedeth little Wormes, or crawling Moths, some in the skirts of the Hive, some within upon the Stoole, wrapt in the drosse or scouring of the Combes, and some without upon the Hive, specially in the cracks of the dawbed Hives. *Plinie/* speaketh thus of them \Nat.hist.li.II.c.19./ *Papilio etiam ignavus luminibus accensis advolitas pestifer, nec uno modo: nam & ipse ceras depascit, & relinquit excrementa quibus teredines gignuntur./* 
\19. *The Snaile/*/ They offend the Bees also with their mealinesse, as the Snailes doe with their sliminesse. Wherefore rid your Hives of these guests. The Moths are easily crusht before or upon the Hive: and the Snailes, though you kill them not, will not long abide, if there be no harbour of long Grasse, Weeds, or other things about the Hives. \20. *What harme the Moth doth./*/ But as for the Moth, if you suffer her, your selfe shall have more cause than your Bees to bee offended. For albeit in the cold Spring shee breed above the Hives, hatching hir young by the heat of the Bees; yet when the heat of the aire will suffice for that purpose, shee chooseth rather to lay her blotes in woollen, their naturall nest and nourishment: especially if it bee nappie, that there she may safely hide them. In which place, till they be growne to their bignesse, they lie fretting and eating the Cloth: and then after a while they creepe out of their skins flying Moths. The Maides that sunne their clothes to rid the Fleas, let them take heed how they doe it neere the Bee-fold, lest they bring in worse enemies than they carried out. If the Woollen be oylie or greasie they like it the better: and for that cause good Huswives Yarne lyeth not long unwoven.
\21. *The Emet./*/ If Emets bee neere your Bees, they will much trouble them, biting them, and hanging upon them: although the 
[cw: Bees,]

===

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

Bees, if they be lustie, will kill many of them that come to the Hive. But if it be a poore Stall, they will in time possesse the Hive, and eat up the Honie. The best remedy against them is to scald them. 
\22. *The Spider./*/ The Spider, as the Moth, doth use to harbour betweene the Hackle and the Hive: where commonly she hath a Bee or twaine in store to feed on, an unfit messe for such a mouth: Sometime she hangeth hir Nets under the Stoole; which easily intangle a wearie Bee, when she commeth laden home, and missing of the lighting place falleth into them: yea, and sometime where the Bees are few, chiefly in the winter, they will bee bold to enter the Hive, and there weave their fatall Webbes, *In foribus laxos suspendit aranea casses/* \Virg.Nat hist.l.11.c.19./ *Aranei quoq vel maxime hostiles: cum prævalvere ut intexant, enecant alveos./*
\23. *The Toad./*/ The Toad is by nature so noysome to the Bees, that while he is about the Hive, though he lie but under the Stoole, the Bees will not prosper. \*The Frog/*/ He is said also to devoure them at the Hive, as the Frog at the Watring-place. \Hist an.l.9.c.40./ \Ibidem./ *Rana Apes, ubi ad aquam accesserint, rapiunt: quamobrem eas apis arii per paludes & stagna unde apes aquantur venari solent. Rubeta etiam apes interimit: subiens enim aditus alves afflat, & observans rapit evolantes. Nullo hæc affic: malo ab apibus potest, sed ab apiario facile interimitur./* Item *insidiantur aquantibus ranæ: quæ maxima earum est operatio, tum cum sobolem faciunt v./* \*V.c.6.n./*51./ *Nec hæ tantum quæ stagna rivosq obsident, verum et rubeta veniunt ultro, adrepentesq foribus per eas sufflant: ad hoc provolant, confestimque abripiuntur./*

\25. *The Bee the Bees greatest enemie./*/ But not any one of these, nor all these togither doe halfe so much harme to the Bees, as the Bees. *Apes api, as homo homini, lupus/*. They make the greatest spoile both of Bees and Honie. For as they of the same Hive live in inviolable peace one with an other; so have they no entercourse, no friendship or societie with others, but are rather at perpetual defiance, and deadly feud with them. In fight they are fierce, and in victorie mercilesse: within the space of a day or twaine, yea of an after-noone sometime, if the Hive bee 
[cw: open]

=== 

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

open that they may have easie passage to and fro, they will have rid him cleane. And therefore all Bees, of all their Enemies, doe most dread strange Bees; knowing well in what danger they are to bee robbed by them both of goods and life. 
\26. *Robbing or fighting of Bees in winter and summer but little./*/ This robbing is practised all the yeere. In winter, as oft as the weather is faire and warme, some wil be prowling abroad And some are so theevishly disposed, that all the summer long, when abundance of Honie is every where to be had for a little labour, they will yet be filching though they die for it. \27. *In the spring more earnest./*/ In the Spring they are more earnest; finding now fit time to fetch after that which they leaft behinde at Harvest, *v./* \*V.n.28.&31./*/ and to repaire their decayed store, both of Honie and Bees. *v./* \*v.n.42./*/ And therefore now have an eie unto them: and defend the weaker swarmes from their violent irruptions. *v./* \*V.c.3.n.65./*/ Those Stalls that have lost their Queene, or too many of their company, or are offended with the corruptnesse of their Combes, or doe dislike their standing for coldnesse, moistnesse, mustinesse, bleetnesse, or unsavourinesse; as taking no pleasure in their lives, doe now easily suffer themselves to be robbed. And if none will come to rob them; then on some faire day they will away together, sometime leaving both Honie and young ones behinde them. 
\28. *The most spoile is made in Harvest./*/ But in *Virgo/* is the most dangerous time of all. Then shall all the Stalls in your Garden bee tryed of what mettle they are made. And *Libra/* would not be much better, but that the most spoile is done before. \29. *What Stalls are most subject to robbing./*/ Little and poore swarmes are now subject to robbing. Likewise those Bees that are offended with the blacknesse and rottennesse of their Combes, caused through age, or wet, or with abundance of noisome stopping; will most of them goe forth in the swarmes, leaving a very few, sometime not past a handfull, in the stocke: which yet in robbing-time will keep the doore, as though the Hive were full: but the Robbers finding their weaknesse, will surely spoile them, if they bee not prevented. How to know such weake Bees, and what to doe to them, see further *c./*3.*n./*46. 
\30. *What Bees are the Robbers./*/ The Robbers are thought to be poore swarmes and 
[sw: stocks]

===

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

\Nat.hist.l.II.c.17/ stocks, which have not sufficiently provided themselves for winter. Of which opinion was *Plinie/* where hee said. *Quod si defecerit aliciuis alvei cibus, impetum in proximas faciunt rapinæ proposito/*. But indeed such are fitter to be robbed, as before is said, than to be robbers. There is no theefe to the rich theefe: who, although he have enough, and more then enough; yet by hooke or by crooke hee will have more, though the poore starve for it. 
\31. *How they begin the fray./*/ At the beginning of Wheat-harvest, the state of flowers decaying, which is alwaies about *Virgo,/* the maine robbing beginneth. Then doe they send forth some of their stoutest yonkers to spie and give the onset: which going about from Hive to Hive so farre as their walke extendeth, doe prove all. Where they have once sped, at their returne they bring more of the their companie; until in the end that whole Stall bee made acquainted with it. Sometime it happenneth, that though there be an hundred Stalls within a walke; yet the robberie is done altogether by one: sometime by two or three, all the rest being quiet. \32. *Theeves of divers Hives agree together in robbing./*/ And this one thing is strange, that whereas no Bees will abide strangers in their Hives with them; yet theeves wil suffer one another, and agree all in stealing, though they be of divers Hives.
\33. *The description of the Bees battell./*/ When the theeves, having first made an entrie, begin to come thicke, and the true Bees perceive themselves to bee assaulted by many; they suddely make an out-crie: and issuing out of their holds by troopes, presently prepare themselves to battell. Some keepe the gates: some as Scout-watches fly about: some runne in againe to see what is done there: some beginne to grapple with the Enemie: and that with such a noise and dinne, as if the Drum did sound an all-arme. \34. *In the battell is heard a sound like a Drum and a Flute./*/ Besides which base sound, you shall eftsoones, in the heat of battell, heare a more shrill and sharpe note, as it were of a Flute.
*....&vox/* \Virg./
*Auditur fractos conitus imitata tubarum./*
Which I am out of doubt is tuned by their generall Commander, encouraging them to fight for their Prince, their lives, and their goods. \35. *The assault of the enimie./*/ Then shall you see the enemies be-

===

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

stir themselves most venterously: some violently through the thickest thrusting in at the gates, others scaling the walls, and tearing them downe. If they once make a breach, without present succour, you shall quickly have an end of that fight. \36. *The defence of the besieged./*/ One the other side, the defendants will behave themselves as bravely, not giving any rest to the enemie: part encountring with them that are without, part with them that have broken in: whom in a while they draw out by the heeles, some dead, and some alive. Likewise without you may see some slaine forthright with the thrust of the Speare: some so deadly wounded, that they are not able to goe three foot from the place: and some more lightly strooken, presently to lose the use of their wings, and for a while to leap up and downe, forward and backward, like mad things. 
How long they live after they are hurt see. *c./*I.*n./*23.
\37. *Neither side willing to yeeld./*/ So loth are these courageous warriours to yeeld on either side, untill there bee no remedie. 
*Ingentes animos augusto in pectore versant
Usque adeo obnixi non cedere, dum gravis aut hos,
Aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga coegit./*
In their fight they are so furious sometime, and so thicke about the Garden, that unlesse you have your complete harnesse, *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*40./ you may not dare to come nigh them.
\38. *The exercise of the the defendants when the enemie receiveth./*/ This also I have noted, that when the robbers are so few, that smal resistance will serve; yet being called forth they will not bee idle: for you shall see some of them running up and downe about the Hive, to seeke and search if any more come: others, like trained Souldiers, practising to fight, here one wrestling with another in single combat, there two, or three, or foure setting against one; as their usuall manner is to deale with the theeves. If you would know whether this fight bee in jest or earnest, with fellowes or with foes, the manner, and the end thereof will shew you. For if they bee fellowes, their fight is not so fierce, and they wil part quietly as friends: whereas if they be foes, though they scape, it shall bee with much adoe. For if the true men cannot kill the theeves; yet will they hold them by the wings so long as they can, in hope to have helpe, though
[cw: they]

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

they be drawne after. Moreover the young Souldiers, which have scarce bin abroad before, you shall see the elder sort goe rounde about them, smoothing and trimming them in every place, as if they did addresse, and hearten them to fight. 
\39. *The Waspes like Vultures./*/ During the time of this battaile, as afterward, the Waspes like Vultures prey upon the dead carkasses, carrying them away peece-meale, *v./* \*v.n./*12./
\40. *The battaile ended they bury their dead./*/ The battaile being ended by repulse of the enemy, those corpses, which the Waspes have leaft, they honestly burie as far from the Hives as they can beare them. \*Virg.Geor./*/
*Tum corpora luce carentum
Ex portant tectis, & tristia funeræ ducunt./*
And then they draw together at the Citie-gates: and there they buzze one to another, as if in their language they did talke of the fight, and commend one an other for their fortitude. 
\41. *The second assault of the enemy./*/ The Robbers, prevailing not that day, will up the next day so soone as it is light, an houre before the Bees use to come abroad: and then doe they make a fresh assault. The Bees finding the enemy among them, are presently up in armes: and so beginnes the seconde skirmish, which, without the taking of the Citie or the overthrow of the assailants (which seldome hapneth) continueth, untill very darknesse part them.
\42. *When the true Bees yeeld, they go with the Conquerors./*/ When the true Bees, finding themselves overmacht with multitude, see there is no remedie, and that no resistance will serve; at length they yeeld, and suffer the Conquerours quietlie to spoile their goods. And after a while, when, by being together in the same Hive and sucking the same Honie, al smel alike; they will joyne with their enemies, and help carrie away their owne goods, and so become friends & live together. At night they lodge with them: but in the day-time they returne with their new fellowes to fetch that is leaft behinde. By this meanes some venterous stalls are suddainly much increased both in Bees and Honie: although when a Swarme not over-stored conquereth a poore stall, and so getteth, by the victorie, more eaters than meat; it

\43. *Remedies./*/ Seeing therefore in so cruell and continuing a fight ofttimes the enemies are Conquerours, and then all is lost; and if they be vanquisht, yet this victorie is not without losse of men and goods, which the enemy ever nowe and then shifteth away; I know your desire is to know how to succour the true men, either by preventing this dangerous conflict, or by rescuing them in the same. For the first read *c./*3.*n./*45.46.47. \44. *To prevent robbing./*/  For the other many practises have been tried: some cast dust, some drinke among them: \45. *And to stay it, if you find it in time./*/ the one whereof doth no good, the other harme. For drinke maketh them to smell all alike, so that the true men cannot knowe the Theeves from their fellowes: and therefore some use to do so, when two swarmes are put together, that they may seeme to be of one companie. If these usual helps be no helps, what help is there then? If you perceive their fighting in time before my great harme be done, then this must you doe. First stop them up close that none can passe ether in or out, leaving onely a breathing place. Then shal you have a double conflict, one within, an other without. The theeves that are within, having no way to escape with their preyes, first or last will be slaine all. They that are without, after a little wrestling, seeing nothing to be had but blowes, will not long abide this bootlesse danger. When you perceive the siege to be raised, and that there is litle or no fighting without; (which will be about an houre after) then may you let out your Bees, making the doore halfe an inch high, and scarce halfe an inch wide. Those few that were within will they bring forth to buriall; some then, some on the morrow. In the evening, when the Bees are all in, shut them up as before. The next day betimes, before the Bees would be abroad, must you looke for some of them againe. When they are come, beat them away with a bough, but kill them not: for so may you do your neighbour a shrewd turne, and your selfe too. 
But let not the Bees out before noone: and then make the doore so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once. So 
[cw: will]

=== 

$*Of the Bees enemies./*/$

will they keepe the Robbers out, and follow their businesse neverthelesse. The next day you may let them out rather: and if the doore be so narrow that it hinder their passage, you may make it wider. If this doe not suffice, but stil the strange Bees will strive to get in; assure your selfe that stall will yeels. And therefore if you bee loth to take it now, because of the Schadons that may corrupt the Honie; *v./* \V.c.10.p.n.2./ then you must looke unto him carefully, lest by little and little it come to little or nothing. 
\46. *When it is too late, and what is then to be done./*/ But if the Bees have yeelded before you are aware of it, so that the theeves rob quietly with out resistance; or have broken the Honie-cels; (which you may perceive by the crumblets of Wax upon the stoole) then, having shut the Hive close assone as you can, the next evening or morning take that is leaft: otherwise in the end you shal lose all. For the Bees there-about smelling the Honie when the Combes are broken, will have it or die for it. 
This fierce and cruell robbing being alwaies in Harvest, when people are busie in the fields, many Hives are leaft Honie-lesse, and they never the wiser. Wherefore it is good to leave some body at home, as well to watch these, as the two legged robbers. 
\47. *Robbing hurtfull also to the Theeves./*/ Neither is this robbing hurtfull onely to those that are robbed, but to the Robbers also. For many of them are daily cut off in the assault: (you may see them lye sprawling at everie Hive-doore) whereby their whole stall sometime is so weakned; that, while they seeke to prey upon others, they become a prey themselves. 
\48. *In what yeeres robbing is most rife/*/ After a moist Spring, when Swarmes are most plentifull, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*5./ is robbing most rife: otherwise there is lesse danger. 
\49. *Bees kill poore swarmes that wander in the spring./*/ Besides those Bees that are thus spoiled in robbing, many also are killed by other stalls when they come to them for succour. For in the Spring those Swarmes that were lateward, or have beene halfe-robbed; when they have spent all their store, the next warme day after, away they flye: some to a tree where they hang til they dead, some adventure into other Hives, where if they have large entrance, that they may throng in suddainly; sometime they scape with

the death of some few, and being mingled together continue with them as one stall: but for the most part they die every each one, *v/*. \*V./*c.I.*n/*22./ 
\50. *To prevent the death of poore swarmes/*/ To prevent this losse, (1) when you percieve them to wax light and weake; drive them into a stall that hath provision enough, *v./* \*V.c.10.p.1.n.10./*/ (2) If it be your hap to see them entring a stall that is well stored, lift up the Hive and let them in together, and so perhaps they may scape: and (3) if you finde any hanging abroad, you may put them into what stall you list. By rearing the stall before a handfull from the stoole, and laying the Bees upon the Table close to the doore. 
\51.*Many killed in swarming/*/ Lastly, the Bees doe much destroy one another in swarming-time. *v.c.5.n./*64,65,66,68,75,76,77,80,&81.
\52. *The Weather./*/ Next unto Bees, the greatest Enemy that the Bees have is unkinde Weather: whereby at all times of the yeare both they and their fruits are much empaired.
\53. *In Summer heat hurteth the Bees./*/ In Summer extreame heate melteth the Combes (specially of Swarmes) and so sheddeth 
the Honie; if the hives be not shaded, and well hackled. It also causeth the Bees to lye out, and so hindreth their swarming. *v.c.5.n.20./*
\54. *In Winter, the Sun-shine in frost and snow./*/ At Winter, the Sunne shining in frostie or snowie weather, is dangerous to the Bees. For the shine tilleth them abroad, and the Frost chilleth them: many as they flye, that they canot returne: and many that returne, while they rest on the ground before the Hive. But the Snow amazeth them, and dazeling their eyes causeth them presently to fall, and with his vehement cold to rise no more: and most of all then, when, to shun the wind, they light in the shade. \55. *The remedie./*/ And therefore if, the Snow lying, the mildnesse of the weather draw them abroad; it is good to stre the Snow with straw, not onely in your Garden, but also without the fences, specially in the Lee-sides, if conveniently you may: and so shall you save a number; which else you might see lying about, like slaine men in a foughten field.  
\55. *Also the Eastern winds and great frosts./*/ Also the freezing Easterne winds, and great Frosts kill many in the Hives that be open, or uncovered: and therefore at such times it is good to shut them up close, *v./*  \*v.c./*3.*n./*61./ and to

see them well hackled, *v.c./*3.*n./*15.
\57. *And the cold continued maketh them sicke./*/ And if the cold continuing keep them long in, it maketh them so sicke, heavy, and chilly; that many dye assone as they come abroad into the aire, unlesse it be very pleasant, *v.c./*3.*n./*62.
\58. *The raine rotteth the Hives./*/ Also the raine doth oft-times soake into the Hives, and so corrupteth the Combes, and killeth the Bees: specially where the company is small, not having heat enough to drie them againe. 
\59. *The remedy./*/ Wherefore provide thay alwaies your hackles be good. And for remedie (if any such chance happen) pull off the hackles in warme daies, that the Sunne may dry the Hives againe. 
\60. *the greatest losse by weather is in the spring: for then infinite multitudes are beaten downe, laden and wearie with stormes and wind./*/ But the greatest losse is in the Spring. For the Bees, specially the young frie (being laded and wearie with their labour) some at their worke, some in the way home, some at the Hive-doore are beaten downe; not onely through suddaine stormes, but also through cold rough windes: and then, unlesse the Sunne shine or the wind lye, they never come home againe: insomuch that sometime you may see the Lanes *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n/*49.61./ strewed with them.
\56 *At the rising of a Cloud they post home/*/ And therefore, when being a field they see a stormie or rainie Cloud arising, presently they hie them home for life: tumbling to the Hive as thick as Haile, thronging, and throwing downe one another before the doore for haste. \62. *Yet wil they goe afield in the midst of a warme shower./*/ Where, if the cold raine catch them before they can recover the Hive, they are in no better case then those that the storme beat downe by the way: although, when they are fresh and light, they will fly abroad in the midst of a warme shower, not caring for it.
They which are thus taken abroad must take their chance, but if you defend your Bee-garden as you ought, *v./* \*v.c./*2.*n./*2.3.4&5./ you shall prevent the fall of many at home. And those that you finde chilled with cold (though they be quite dead, without sense, motion, and breath, yea and have lien so all the day) you may, if you be disposed revive with the warmth of your hand; so that it will seeme a miracle unto you. For presently (their spirit returning) you shall see them begin to pant and breath againe: and anone they will flye away as lustie as the

best. But if you spie any store of such dead or halfe-dead Bees, then your way is to put them in a Glasse, and covering it, to turne it round against the fire, till you see them ready to flye. 
\64. *The wind causeth many to be drowned./*/ Also where Palme-withies, or other trees whereon they gather; doe hang over the water; the rough windes throw downe and drowne a number of them, while they bee at worke. Many also, where there are no such trees, when they come but to drinke. 
For remedie of the first, cut downe the trees: and for the other, see *c.6.n.56./*
\*Nat.hist.l.II.c.19/*/ *Tot hostibus tot casibus tam mumificum animal expositum est/*
\66. *The last and worst Enimie of all./*/ ¶ There remaineth yet another Enemie worse than all these. For these all doe wrong the Bees but by little and little; some in their good, some in their persons: and there is a remedie shewed, if industrie be not wanting, against them all. But this, when he commeth, playeth sweep-stake with them; carrying away both Honie, and Wax, and Bees, and Hive, and all at once: and there is not sufficient remedie found, either in the Bee-master, of in the Bees themselves against him: neither shall I, with all my skill, be ever able to devise any; unlesse the wisest of the Land, when they meet together, will joyne with me in the invention. For the first the Bees are least destitute of their Keepers helpe, seeing at the times of greatest danger, he cannot alwaies be *sub Dio/* with them, nor they conveniently *sub Lare/* with him: although some have, for their safetie, put this in practise, housing them and shutting them up close all the Winter: but not without much inconvenience. For by this meanes they are debarred of their necessarie recreation *v:/* \*V.c.1.n.59.&c.3.n.60./*/ in a warme houre, when it happeneth: and if by chance they breake forth, they lose their way in againe, and their lives withall. And as they want herein their Keepers helpe, so have they no meanes to save themselves, no not so much as the silly sheepe, which happily may runne away. For their resistance, which against some Enemies doth often prevaile, against the violence of this flie *Tenebrio/* availeth nothing at all: who stealing upon

Although I have read a Storie of a Stall, that being stolne did sharply punish the Malefactor, making him submit himselfe unto their Master, and to aske him forgivenesse. Indeed I will not be bound for the truth of it, for it is no childe of mine: but if any man desire to take it as it is, he shall have it as good cheape as I *Cum nocto latro apes S. Medari sub-ripuisset, apes ipsæ in sancti viri ultionem, relictis vasis suis, in malefactorem illum circumquaque diffugientem acerrima catenus instimulatione perfecutæ sunt, quosque ad Sanctum, vellet nollet, regrederetur, & ejus provolutus vestigiis suppliciter pro commisso crimine veniam precaretur. Cui mox ut Sanctus manum extendit benedictionis; apes, tanquam obedientes, ab ejus insecutione cessaverunt, & antiquo Domnini sui dominio evidenter sese reddiderunt./* Laur. Surius in vita S Medardi.Tom.3. When a Theefe by night had stollen *S. Medards/* Bees, the Bees in their Masters quarrell, leaving their HIve, set upon the Malefactor, and eagerly pursuing him which way soever he ranne, would not cease stinging of him, until they had made him, whether he would or no, to go backe againe to their Masters house, and there falling prostrate at his feet submisly to crie him mercie for the crime committed. Which being done, so soone as the Saint extended unto him the hand of benediction; the Bees, like obedient Servants, did forthwith stay from persecuting him, and evidently yeelded themselves to the ancient possession and custodie of their Master. 
It were to be wished that *Pares culpa/* might be Pares pana, that all like offendors might have like punishment. But sith our Bees are not of *S.

fore I humbly and heartily entreat all those, whether they be high or low, which shall reape either profit or pleasure by these my paines, that they would endeavour, as much as in them lyeth, by themselves and by their friends, that against this odious rapine it may be enacted, as a Law of the *Medes/* and *Persians/* which altereth not; that they which feloniously breake open these true labourers houses, shall, like other House-breakers, bee deemed and judged as guiltie of Burglairie, and so have no benefit or favour by the *Muses/*, that thus violate the *Muses/* sacred Favourites. And heere, now my hand is in (though it may seeme a hard digression) let me begge the like boone for those other necessarie creatures, which, for their like certaine and generall profit, the Proverbe hath joyned with them in speciall commendation to the world.

They serve for mans use both without and within, not only to feed the belly, but also to cloath the back: for which necessarie uses, they deserve especially to be beloved and defended of all. And yet I thinke that in any thing, nay in all things else, there is not so much wrong and spoile done to the Countrey, as in them alone: Sheepe-stealing, through foolish pittie, is now growne so common and so continuall. Whereby, besides the infinite losses which true Subjects daily suffer in that kinde, the Commonwealth sustaineth an other great damage in Corne; the Husbandmen oft-times fearing and forbearing to sold their Land, lest their losse should be greater than their gaine. Surely, in my opinion, the very Boot-halers, or High-way-Robbers are more worthy favour than such. For they are men of more generous spirits, both apt for service themselves, and to breed bold Souldiers for their Prince and Country, who, by good admonition, better imploiments, or conscience of the sinne, are oft-times reclaimed: Whereas these Night-Ravens, for the most part, are base cowardly Knaves, neither fit for service, nor labour, a meere burthen to the Common-

##*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/##

{T}hree moneths of the twelve are rich and plentifull (in which the Bees gather abundantly, and store themselves for all the yeere) *Gemini, Cancer, Leo/*; but *Cancer/* is better than both the other. In *Virgo/* and *Libra/* they live little of their daily labour from hand to mouth: little increasing or diminishing their store; unlesse they fall into the hands of Robbers, and then, without reskue, they lose all. \1. *In seven moneths the Bees spend of the stocke./*/ But in the other seven, either wholly or partly they feed upon that store, which the three rich moneths did afford them. For *Scorpio/* hath but the poore gleanings of decaying plants: the three still moneths nothing at all. *Pisces/* beginneth to put forth fresh plants, which in *Aries/* and *Taurus/* are well increased: but this breeding time the mouths are multiplied more often than the meat, which +\*Rainie, cold, and windie./*/ unkinde weather oftentimes suffereth them not to fetch in. So that all this while, they, more or lesse, spend upon the stocke: yea the weaker stalls somewhat longer, being not so well able to indure the sharpe aire: and therefore, for want of some store to feed on betweene whiles at home, I have knowne some die after Mid-*Gemini./* 
\2. *Three sorts of swarmes diversely provided./*/ For the seven spending moneths, some swarmes are sufficiently provided: which you may reckon as Jewels, the verie *Spes gregis/*; whose increase the next yeere is certaine, if they be not over-hived. Some are not provided for halfe the time: and these, as desperately poore, are not worth the 
[cw: feeding.]

===
$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

feeding. Others are provided for six, or five, or foure moneths: which, by the helpe of feeding, may live and doe well. 
\3. *The first sort./*/ Of the first sort are timely prime swarmes unbroken: also faire Castlings not over hived, before *Cancer/*; yea and in kinde or backward Summers before *Mid-Cancer:/* when the black-bery-blossomes are not yet come, *v./* \*V.c.5.n.11./*/ nor the hony-dewes gone: For such have sufficient both company and time, to make sufficient provision.
\4. *The second./*/ Of the second sort are the over-little and late swarmes, whose paucitie and povertie makes them unlustie to travell for more, and unable to keepe what is gotten or given them. Such are sure to bee put before winter be past, by cold and hunger, out of hunger and cold. And therefore if you have omitted to save such by *Union; v./* \*V.c.5.n.68./*/ yet omit not to save that little which they have, and your  vaine labour and cost in seeing them. *v.c.10.p.1.n.3.in III./*
\5. *The third onely are to be fed./*/ Of the third sort are midling and indifferent swarmes, which by their earnest labour have gotten well, and gathered good store of wealth together: but yet, for some want of number or time, the summer leaveth them in some want of provision. 
\6. *Stockes out of proofe never to be fed./* As for Stockes that have stood two yeeres, and yet have not sufficient stocke for these seven moneths; (whether they be such as have gotten it, or having gotten it have lost it againe) they are out of proofe: and therefore fit to be taken, not fed. *v.c.10.p.1.n.3.in III./*/
\7. *Trie your swarmes in/* Virgo./ But because unkinde summers may make good warmes but poore, as contrarily a plentifull summer may much mend the worst; after *Mid-Virgo,/* when Bees are to be taken, *v./* it behoveth you to trie all your swarmes, by knocking and poising them: for the noise will tell you the greatnesse of the company, and the weight, their wealth. They that are used to poise them by hand, will resolve you readily in this point by aime: which till you know to doe, the Scales may direct you. \8. *What quantitie of Hony is requisite./*/ For having taken the just weight of the Hive and all together, if, the fore-knowne weight of the leere pleeted Hive being deducted, there remaine not fifteene pound in all, to
[cw: wit,]

===

$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

wit, for five pound *v./* \*V+in.c.5.n.45./*/ in Bees, the double weight in honie and wax; that swarme is desperately poore, *v./* and fitter to be taken than fed+. If the swarme with his store doe weigh betweene fifteene and twentie, due feeding *v./* \*V.n.14,&c./*/ may save him. If betweene twentie and five and twentie, hee is able to shift for himselfe, and live without helpe. If betweene five and twenty and thirtie, esteeme him as right good, plentifully provided even for a hard winter, and fitted to be forward the next spring +. And above the greater the store is, the better increase it promiseth. Unlesse, in some extraordinarie yeere, the Hive be cloyed with too much: *v./* \*V.c.10.p.1.n.3,in VII&VIII./*/ for too much as well to Bees as men, doth ofttimes more harme than good. 
+Yet they that have but a small Bee-fold, and are content to be often troubled (specially at the second feeding-time) may try those that lacke a pound or two of this weight.
+And yet such though never so good, will perish neverthelesse, if they chance to lose their Queene: *v./* \*V.c.1.n.6./* which sometime happeneth to those that are much troubled in the hiving.*v.c.5.n.52./*
\9. *Trie againe in/* Pisces *or/* Aries/./ Moreover, because a long winter and a rough spring following, with some other accidents, may waste them that were good, as, on the other side, a short winter and a milde spring may helpe those that were scantily provided; it shall not be amisse to try againe in *Pisces/* or *Aries,/* those that you suspect; and to feed them if you see cause.*v.n.15.&16./*

\10 *The Bees foode./*/ THE naturall food of Bees is Honie: for want, or sparing whereof, many other things have beene devised. *Aristotle/* mentioneth Figs, and all such sweet things. *Apiarii ficus ac reliqua ad genus dulcia cibum apponnut./* \Hist.li.9.c.40/ and *Plinie/* speaking more particularly commendeth Raysings, and Figges, and teased Wooll, wet in sweet Wine made of Raisings, or  new Wine boiled, or Hony-water. \Nat hist.li.21.c.14./ *Si cibus deesse censeatur apibus, vuas passas siccasue, sicosque, tusas ad fores earum posuisse conveniet: item lanas tractas madentes passo aut defrunto, aut aqua mulsa./* And some of our Country-men have practised to give them Bay-salt, Beane-flower, Ground-mault, rosted Wardens, and Apples, and sweet Wort. All 
[cw: which]

===

$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

which things though they will be spend; yet cannot they be preseved by them without Honie. 

Touching the councell of *Plinie./* this is to be noted, that if you place their food *ad fores/* before the doore, it will draw strange Bees unto them: whereby the hives of the one, and the goods of the other will be endangered: if you place it abroad from your Hive, then wil it be common: and if within upon the stoole, which is best, then must you remove it in time, *v.n./*11 otherwise it will be no better for them, than if it were set *ad fores/*. And as for the devise of teased Wooll, it is a fitter meanes to catch Bees, than to feede them. For if the liquor be above the Wooll, it will lime the wings of many; if not, many will be intangled in the small haires, as Birds in a grin. Cover it therefore with a linnen cloth so that the Bees may not creepe betweene. 
\11. *Private feeding./*/ The manner of feeding Bees in their Hives is divers. Some give them Honie in a spoone: but that way many of them be-smeare their wings: and if their fellowes licke them not cleane presently, before the cold chill them, they die. Others, to avoid this inconvenience, give it them in a warme Toste: but this way wasteth the hony, & doth not altogether avoid the former inconvenience. Others have other devices. But indeed the only good way to feed Bees is with a combe, after this manner. First, take a fresh Combe of Live-honie out of a Hive, & lay it upon some Prop or stay, that the Bees may worke, as well under as upon. This Prob may be a woodden grate seven or eight inches square, made of two sides halfe an inch deepe, and three ribs fastened into them with Dove-railes, or with small nailes. For a need two severall square stickes may serve: but then you cannot so quickly either see it in, or take it out. 
Then in a faire calme evening (when the heat of the day, and the Bees worke is past) place this upon the stoole: so that the Feeding-combe be reared as neere the Hive combes as may be, not touching them, lest the Bees fasten this and them together. Then see that the Hive, set downe in his place, be close every where: and at the doore but room enough for a Bee or two to passe. Then will these Bees to worke afresh, not ceasing day nor night untill they have rid the Combe cleane: which within eight and fortie houres will be effected. If they need any more, the next evening doe
[cw: likewise.]

===

$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

likewise. But alwaies when it waxeth darke, and the Bees are all in; barre up the doore: and let them not out till the next evening, when other Bees are quiet. Or if you doe it in the morning, be sure also to take out the Combe, whether he be rid or no. And still leave the Hive close, with a narrow passage. 
\12. *Carelesse feeding is starving./*/ If your poore Bees should not be thus defended from strangers, the feeding of them would prove a starving of them. For the Borderers smelling the bootie will be sure to have part of it, if they can come at it: and when that is done, they will set upon the other, and so spoile all: as often it falleth out through this carelesnesse. Which causeth some to condemne all feeding of Bees, as painfull and fruitlesse: saying, If you feed them not, they can but die: and so will they doe when you have bestowed your labour and cost. But this is disproved by experience: for those, which being fit to be fed *v./* are thus fed, do seldome miscarrie. That summer they provide sufficiently for winter, and the next they are as likely to swarme and be fat as an other. 
\13. *Publike feeding./*/ You may also feed your poore swarmes together, (if you have no neighour-Bees to beguile them) by setting any refuse-honie or leavings abroad in your Garden, having first barred up those that need it not. This feeding-Hony, as that which is stolne, when they have first taken their reflection, they convey into their void Cells: which, because they cannot now shut them up, as before *Virgo,/* for want of wax; *v./* \*V.c.6.n.15./*/ they doe but halfe-fill. And therefore they first spend of this last gotten hony, reserving that, which was more safely laid up, unto the last.  
\14. *The first time of feeding./*/ It is good to feed Bees before they need: (that they may save their store, which they have shut up in their Cells, until the spring) namely, in the later part of *Virgo,/* when the Combes are taken, *v./* \*V.c.10.p.1.n.2./*/ or in *Libra./* For those that have spent their owne store, and have little or nothing leaft in the end of Winter, as so discouraged and so feeble with fasting; that knowing their thin bodies can beare out no cold, they wil not come abroad, but when they are fed: unlesse the weather be exceeding warme and calme: and the more they keepe in the

weaker still they are, and lesse apt to breed. But those whose rathe feeding hath caused them to spare their store till the Spring, will be as cheerefull as the best: in any reasonable weather they will abroad, and fetch in that fruitfull *Ambrosia,/* which causeth them presently to increase and multiply. *v.c.4.n.12./*
At this first time therefore first finish the publike feeding: and then begin the private, specially of those that are under eighteene pound: to which if you give now the better part of their+ due allowance; you may supply the defects of them, as also the rest, at the second feeding-time, when their need will better appeare. 
+Their due allowance, first and last to be given them, is so much at least, as the swarme with his store lacketh of twentie pound. *v.n.8./* 

\15. *The second time of feeding./*/ In *Pisces/* or *Aries/*, as soone as the weather is warme (not before, lest the cold chill them in their worke) if you feare they will lacke, (which you may perceive by their lightnesse & unwillingnesse to come abroad) supply their want againe, and againe, if need be. But in this second feeding, for lacke of a Hony-combe, take a drie Combe, reserved for the purpose, and poure thereon so much Honie as it may receive. If you thinke it be not liquid enough; then either warme it first over the fire, or else spread it all over the Combe with your finger, that it may sinke into the Cells: (for which purpose Live-hony is best) then use this honied combe as the Hony-combe. *v.n./*11.
\16. *The third time of feeding./*/ If either these fed Bees, or any other, chance afterward to lacke (namely in *Taurus/*, or somwhat before or after) then feed them daily untill mid-*Gemini/*, giving them, everie evening or morning betimes, a spoonefull of Honie; and taking away the Combe againe before other Bees be at worke. But this is to be done without intermission: for the Bees will duly looke for it, and languish, if once or twice they lacke it. 
If you use to knocke the Hive, when you put in the Honie; they will come downe together, like sheepe to a call, when they are to be fodered.
By this meanes I have saved swarmes that forsooke their Hives for hunger, hiving them againe in their owne Hives: which proved good the same yeere.
