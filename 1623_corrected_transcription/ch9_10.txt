##*Of the removing of Bees./*/##

\1. *Five things to be avoided in removing Bees./*/ {I}N removing of Bees be carefull to avoid these five evills: 1. hindering of their swarming: 2. and of their Hony-gathering: 3. breaking of their Combes: 4. robbing: 5. and losse of Bees. 
\2. *Remove alwaies in faire weather/*/ Remove alwaies in a faire day, and, as neere as you can guesse in setled weather. For when they are moved to another place, if it be within their circuit or walke; they will fly to their old standing as soon as they are let goe, and hanker about it three or foure daies, and sometime longer: where if the cold wet catch them, many lose their lives. And if you remove them out of their knowledge, then, as amazed in an uncouth place, they flie about for a while viewing the countrie, and searching for their old home: when they are wearie, they rest wheresoever: and if foule weather come upon them, they are in like danger. 
\3. *Not in Winter/*/ For the time of the yeere, remove not in the three still moneths, or in a fortnight afore or after, for losing the Bees. For if foule weather fall not, the very still cold will kill many, while they are straying abroad: and of those that returne, being not yet acquainted with the Hive doore, some will fall short, some upon the Hive: where, while they rest panting, the cold chilleth them. 
\4. *Nor in Summer/*/ *Taurus, Gemini,/* and especially *Cancer,/* are naught, for hindering the swarming, as well as their hony-gathering: and *Cancer/* for danger also of breaking their soft Combes. 
In *Leo/* though the swarming time be past, and robbing time not yet come; yet there remaineth some honie-gathe-

ring, and the Combes being then most weightie and most weake, the danger of breaking them is greatest. 
To remove in *Virgo/* (when the Bees doe ever use to be trying of masteries) *v./* \*V.c.7.n.31./*/ is dangerous for robbing. For the *Indigin√¶/* or old inhabitants of the Garden (as they goe about prying for booties) finding new neighbours come among them, will be sure to visit them: and while the chiefe of their strength is stragling abroad, seeking for their old dwelling; they will bring the rest such cheere to their house-warming, as shall haply make the house too hot for them. And then they must be faine to goe along with them, and helpe to carrie their owne goods after them. *v.c.7.n.42./*
\5. *The Autumne and Spring are fit times for removing./*/ The fittest time is either in *Libra/* and the fore-part of *Scorpio/*, that they may thoroughly know their new standing before the weather be too cold; or in *Aries/* and the later part of *Pisces,/* that they may be acquainted with it before much gathering of Honie. 
Neverthelesse, if you have Bees in other mens keeping, whose care and skill you mistrust; you were better to remove them unseasonably with some losse, than to hazard all by their ignorance and negligence.
\6. *Libra, the best month in all the yeare./*/ But if you may choose, remove in *Libra/* onely, which is simply the best.
\7. *When to remove a swarme./*/ And for the removing of a Swarme into an other Garden, (whether it be neere or far off) the only time is the evening or night next after the hiving: that he may be at his new standing, readie to worke, in the morning; and so lose no time, nor breake his first Combe in the carriage.
\8. *The time of the day, and manner of removing./*/ IN the evening, when you meane to remove, an houre before sun-set prop up the Hive from the Stoole, with three Bolsters two or three inches thicke, that the Bees may ascend from the stoole. About halfe an houre after, having prepared an other stoole of the same height, and covered it with your Mantle so that the middle of the mantle be over the middle of the stoole; move the stall with his stoole, if you may, a little aside; and set this covered stoole in his place: or if it cannot well be moved, then set the covered stoole close

to the old stoole, either beside it, or before it. This done, lift up the stall from his old stoole and set it upon the new: and then wiping the Bees from the old stoole (if any remaine) with your Brush; either take the stoole away, or cover it with a cloth. And then if your new stoole be onely a planke without legs, borne up by some other meanes; it is good to set it upon the old. Within a while when the Bees are all in, knit the mantle at the fowre corners over the top of the Hive so as the knots may not slip: and presently binde it to the Hive about the middle slackly with a small line, and wrest it fast with a little sticke. And so is the stall ready to be removed.
\9. *The usuall manner of removing./*/ They use commonly to make no more adoe, but after sun-set when the Bees are at rest, to lift up the stall, and set it upon a mantle spread on the ground, and so to binde it up, leaving the Bees upon the stoole (which in a good stall are not a few) behinde them. \10. *Which is fit for poore stalles./*/ Which way, for such stalls as have all their Bees up in the Hive, may serve well enough.
\11. *How a good Stall is to be carried./*/ The best way to carrie your+ Stall is upon a Cowl-staffe betweene two.
+If you have many to remoove; two lustie fellowes may beare two or three of them at once: but let them be all fast bound together.
\12. *How a bad./*/ If it be light, one may carrie it in his hand. But, howsoever, be sure it hang perpendicularly for feare of breaking the Combes; specially if you chance to remove before *Libra/*, when the waxe is soft and the lower partes of the Combes are heavie with Schadons, as well as the upper with Honie. 
\13. *What to doe when they are brought home./*/ When you have brought the Stall home, you may let it stand bound as it is, all night in the house. The morrow, when the weather serveth, set him on his seat: but if it be foule all the next day, keepe him still bound untill it be faire. And then having loosed the line, and taken away the Mantle, cloome him up presently: leaving, for three or foure faire daies, a very narrow entrance, for feare of robbing. \14. *And what when they are seated./*/ For their new neighbours, even now also (though not so eagerly as in *Virgo/*) will prove them: and they will not so stoutly resist, untill they be acquainted in the place.

##*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/##

Wherein is shewed first the *Vindemiation/* or taking of the Combes: secondly the trying of the *Wax/* and *Honie/*, with the making of *Meth/* or *Hydromel/*: and thirdly, the singular vertues of them, for the use and comfort of man. 

*The first part of this Chapter sheweth the taking of the Combes./*
\1 *The first kind of Vindemiation/*/ {T}He most usuall, and generally most usefull manner of taking of the Combes, is by killing the Bees. For which the naturall and seasonable time is the latter part of *Virgo/*, from the end of the *Dog-daies/* unto *Libra/*: because till then the Combes are full of Schadons, which deceive the Honi-men, making the Hive heavier and the Honie worse: (for the young Bees as well as the Coome corrupt the same, \2. *The best time for killing Bees./*/ *Pulli & rubra sordes sunt mals saporis, & succi suo mella corrumpunt./* \Col.l.9.c.15/ and after that time, the weather waxeth colder, not so fit for the running and working of the Honie: and the Honie is likely to decrease, either by their owne spending or by the spoiling of Robbers. Except in the heath-countries, where their gathering lasteth longer: for there they defer their taking untill Mid-*Libra./*
\3 *What Stalls are to be taken./*/ At this time therefore consider with your selfe what Stalls you wil kill. Swarmes that maie live, yeerlings, and two yeerlings that are in proofe, keepe for store. Those of three or foure yeeres, which, by reason of their not swarming the last summer, are 
[cw: ful]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

full of Bees, lightly are fat, and therefore worth the taking: but they are also good for store, unlesse the frequent Honi-dewes have made them over fat. But those of that age which have cast twice (except they were very forward and had beat away their Drones betimes) are they not likely to+ continue, and thereofre are to be taken. 
+If you would have any such to stand an other yeere, and not to bee weakened by his late castling; put it backe into the stocke againe, *v.c.5.n.11./*
Likewise all poore swarms unworthy to be fed, *v./* \*v.c./*8.*n./*4./ and all light stocks whose stocks are decayed: *v./* \*V.c.8.n.6./*/ For they will surely die. Neither is it safe to trust any after they have stoode five yeeres: unlesse it be some speciall kinde of Bees, which cast often, and yet beating away their Drones betimes, doe still keepe themselves in heart. For such I have kept nine or ten yeeres: and I have heard of some of a greater age. Moreover, all stalls of three yeeres old and upward, that have mist swarming two yeeres together: and especially those, that having lyen forth the summer before, did not cast this last summer: for such doe seldome after prosper. It is therefore better to take them now while they are good, than in a vaine hope of increase, to keep them till they perish. Likewise if you have any that are very fat and full of Honie, (as some yeeres some will be, even down to the Stoole) those that are rope and ready to yeeld their fruit. One such is worth three or foure. Take them therefore in their season: For wanting roome to breed in (their Cells being full of Honie) they will decay by little and little, and consume to nothing. And therefore, as in a wet hungry yeere you must keepe the best, so in a drie yeere, rich and plentifull in Honie-dewes, the worst are like to prove best for store. 
But generally take the best, and the worst. *In medio virtus./* And ever suspect those that rid not their Drones in time, *v./* \*V.c.4.n.30./*/ 
Also those which the Robbers doe eagerly assault, *v./* \*V.c.3.n.50./*/ and if their Combes bee once broken, *v./* delay not their taking.   
\4 *The manner of killing Bees/*/ Having made choice of your Stall to be taken, some two or three houres before + Sun-set dig a hole in the ground, as neere the Stoole as may be, about eight or nine inches 
[cw: deepe]

deepe and almost as wide as the Hive-skirts: laying the small earth round about the brims. Then having a litle sticke slit in one end & shript at the other, take a Brimstone-match 5. or 6. inches long, and about the bignesse of your little finger, and making it fast in the slit, sticke the sticke in the middle or side of the hoale; so that the top of the Match may stand even with the brim of the pit: and then set another by him drest after the same manner, if that bee not sufficient. When you have fired these Matches at the upper ends, set over the Hive: and presently shut it so close at the Skirts, that none of the smoake may come forth. So shall you have the Bees dead and downe in lesse than a quarter of an houre. 
+That you may have the evening and morning to finish your worke; while the store-Bees be at rest: which otherwise will trouble you in handling the Honie, if by any meanes they may come at you. But if the weather be cold enough to keepe them in, or the house bee close enough to keepe them out; you may take whay time of the day you please. 
+Matches are made of linnen rags and Brimstone, after the manner that maids make Sluts. First, melt pounded Brimstone: then take a linnen rag a foot long, and holding both the ends in one hand, dip the rest in the melted Brimstone, turning it up and downe, with a sticke: then taking one of the ends in the other hand, winde it a little; for hard winding makes it burne the worse. This cut in the middle maketh twaine. 
\5. *Sundry meanes to kill Bees./*/ Next unto the brimstone is the smoake of Bunt or great Puc-fists, Tuchwood, or Mushrums, used in like manner: but they are neither so quicke, nor so sweet. And for a need, some smother them with danke Straw, or Hay: but then the Honie will smell of the smoake. And therefore some drowne them in a Tub of water: but that hurteth the Honie, and doth the Hive no good: and, besides that, many of the Bees being not quite dead, will sting them that handle the Honie. 
\6. *The Bees being dead, house the Hive./*/ The Bees being dead, carrie the Hive into the house, &c. *See Part 2./* If any Bees escape, they will die that night: but if you feare they will doe any harme, you may kill them presently upon the Stoole. 
\7. *The second kinde of Vindemiation./*/ An other way to take the Combes is by Driving the Bees. The maner of it is this. At Mid-summer, or wihin two or three daies after, in a faire morning an houre before Sun-

rising, lift the Stall from the Stoole, and set it upright and fast on the ground in a Brake *v/* \*V.c.5.n.24./*/ \9 *The time and manner of Driving Bees./*/ with the bottome upward: and quickly cover it with an emptie Hive, having first laid two spleets upon the full Hives bottome, that the emptie Hive may stand the faster. Then wrapping a Mantle *v./* \*V.c.5.n.48./*/ round about the Chinke or meeting of both the Hives, and binding it fast with a small cord above and beneath, that a Bee may not get forth, clap the full Hive or *Remover/* round about a good many times, pawsing now and then a little betweene, that the Bees may ascend into the void Hive. And when you thinke that most of them are driven up (which will bee about half an houre after) set the upper Hive or *Receiver/* upon the old stoole: BUT bee sure &c. *as it followeth note/* 15.
Provided alwaies, before you goe about this businesse, that all the Stalls in your Garden be first shut up, lest they trouble you and your poore Bees.  
\9. *This driving of Bees unprofitable./*/ This kinde of taking is much applauded at the first, because men thinke thereby to save both Bees and Honie: but it falleth out with them as it is in the Proverbe, *All covet, all lose./* For the Honie is neither so good, as being not yet in season, and to bee corrupted with the Schadons, *v./* which can hardly be cleane taken from it; neither so much by almost the one halfe, sith there remaine yet six or seven weekes of Honie-gathering. 
\11. *And the Bees driven, few and poore./*/ And the Bees, as men forcibly driven from their goods and children, are so discouraged, that they seldom thive after it: specially those that have swarmed; seeing their companie is leaft but small, and the after-brood is destroyed, which should have supplyed the roomes of them that are gone. And as for those that have not cast, they might after that time yeeld a swarme, which would be better than the whole stall being driven: and if they did not swarme at all, they would they bee so much the better, either to take for Honie, or to keepe for store. *v.c.5.n.22./* 
\12. *Another kinde of driving/*/ This Driving of Bees into leere Hives being nothing so profitable as it seemeth, I doe rather commend unto you the Driving of one stall into another: whereby the fruit of one 
[cw: is]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

is taken and the lives of both are saved together. 
\13. *At two times./*/ And thus some are to be driven in the latter part of *Virgo,/* when they have done breeding, *v./* \*V.n.2./*/ and some in *Aquarius/* or *Pisces,/* before they begin to breed againe. *v.c.4.n.12./* 
\14. *Driving in Virgo./*/ In *Virgo/* such stalles onely are to be driven, as are fit to bee killed. *v./* \*V.n.3./*/ and that into yeerelings or two-yeerelings, which that yeere have cast twice, and therefore have few Bees leaft in them; but yet have Honie enough. 
\15. *The manner of driving in Virgo./*/ The manner of it is this. 

Having first placed these two stalles, the *Remover/* that is driven, and the *Receiver,/* as neere as may be one to another, and so let them stand together six or seaven daies, til they be well acquainted with their standings; when you see the weather being faire and constant, late in an evening, about ten a clocke, set the *Remover/* fast on the ground in a Brake, *v./* \*V.c.n.24./*/ and the *Receiver/* upon him and binde them close together, as in the former driving. And then, by often clapping the *Remover/* between your hands about the space of a quarter of an houre (now and then pawsing betweene) having driven most of the Bees into the *Receiver,/* and so mingled them all together; let them so stand til the morning. In the morning about Sun-rising, if the weather bee faire; (otherwise you must stay + longer) doe the like: having first shut and covered the other stalls, *v.c.5.n.25./*
+If the weather fit not the next day, you may safely stay till if doe fit; so that no Bees get forth in the meane space.  
This done, set the *Receiver/* upon the *Removers/* stoole: BUT, be sure to bolster him up with three Tile-shardes, that the driven Bees may easily get into the Hive on every side. And then knocke the *Remover/* downe upon the Table two or three foot square, set close to the forepart of the stoole: and, by clapping of the Hive, presently get as many of the Bees forth as you can. And forthwith carry the *Remover/* about a Pearch from the stoole: and there laying him downe, so that the Combes may lie edgelong, after a little while clap him twice or thrice, which will make many of the Bees to fly forth. Then remove him to another place about the former distance, and there doe likewise: and so to an other, and an other, untill few or no Bees will come forth by this meanes
[cw: And]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

And ever when you be come to a new place, and there have got out some Bees; leave there the *Remover/* and goe directly to the *Receiver,/* and a little beyond: for the Bees will follow you, and thereby the sooner recover the Hive. 
After this, having removed the *Receiver/* againe, and laid him with the Combes edglong as before; stay till you see the Bees ascended to the highest part of the Combes in the Skirt of the Hive: and then resting it on the edhe of a Kiver, and turning the Bees toward your readiest hand; with two or three claps force them out into the Kiver, and there clap them out as before. This iterate as often as you see any store arise unto the upmost part of the Hive-skirt. Which when they cease to doe, the Hive is well nigh rid of his Bees. Betweene whiles, carrie the Kiver to the stall, and knocke out the Bees upon the Table. Then, having first loosed the spleets ends, take out the Combes, beginning at one side: and ever when you have taken out a Combe, wipe off the Bees with a fether of a Goose wing into the Kiver, and send it in, out of their sight. When the Combes are all gone, set the Hive and Kiver before the *Receiver,/* that the Bees may take up your leavings. As soone as they begin to bee quiet, take away the Bolsters, and cloome up the Hive very close, leaving the doore no wider than must needs bee. And when all is done, set open your other stalls: and carry the Hive and Kiver from among the Bees.
\16. *How to help those driven Bees that want./*/ If you thinke there be not sufficient provision for this double Stall in that single Hive, bestow a full Combe or twaine, *v./* \*V.c./*8*n./*11/ as need requireth, of the *Removers/* upon them: and thus will your Bees delight and prosper in new Wax, which in olde corrupt Combes would decay.
\27. *Driving in Pisces./*/ In *Aquarius/* or *Pisces,/* when you have poised your Hives, those that you find by their lightnesse, unlikely to indure the Spring for lacke of food, you may in like manner drive into such provided Stalls, as have fewest Bees: and so wil those *Receivers/* be much the better, and cast both the rather, and the greater Swarmes. And if by chance, at any time after,
[cw: you]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

you find a Stall decayed, thus may you save them. Otherwise, if he be fit to be fed (*v.c.8.n.5./*) feed him, *v.c.8.n.15./* and 16.
\18. *How to revive those that are chilled in driving./*/ If, the weather being not warme, you finde some Bees chilled about the Hive; fill your warme hands full of them, and anone they will flie away to their fellowes. *v:/* \*V.c.7.n.63./*/ And if haply any chance to pricke you, (which they will seldom doe) your hand will have the more vertue to revive the rest. 
This driving wil not be so troublesome as the former, because the poore Bees will easily change their hungry home for a place of plentie. 
\19. *A third kind of Vindemiation./*/ Exsection or Castration, is a third kind of taking: which is the cutting out of part of the Combes, part being leaft for the Bees provision. And this was to bee done at two times in the yeare, *In ortu & occasu Virgiliarum/*.
\22 *Exsection used at two times./*/ *Virgiliarum ortus/* after *Columella/*, l.9.c.14. is the eight and fortieth day from *√Üquinoctium vernum/*: after *Var./*: the foure and fortieth: but then you must understand that they accounted the *√Üquinoctium/* to bee in the eight degree of *Aries/* (although *Hipparchus/*, as Columella saith, had then found it to be the first) With us the comicall rising of *Vergili√¶/* or *Pleiades/* being seven starres in the neck of *Taurus/*, and in the four and twentieth degree of that signe, is knowne to be in the third of May, the five and fiftieth day after the true *√Üquinoctium/*: which jumpeth with the account of *Columella./* And *Vergiliarum occasus/*, being in the same degree of the opposite signe, is upon the fift day of November.
\21. *What part to be exsacted is uncertaine./*/ But what part is to be taken, and what leaft, I find it not determined. *Priore messe/* (saith Columella *dum adhuc rura pastionibus abundant, quinta pars favorum; posteriore cum iam metuitur hyems, tertia relinquinda est./*\l.9.c.15/ But *Varro/* then requireth for their store two third parts; *ut ne plus tertia pars exacatur mellis, reliquum hyemationi relinquatur/*. And *Aristotle/* because (as Col. granteth) *hic modus non est in omnibus regionibus certus/*, doth not prescribe any certaine part, but leaving it to the discretion of the Bee-master, saith, *Cum favos apiarii eximunt, cibitantum relinquant, quantum per hymem sufficiat: quod si satis sit, servatur examen; sin minus, vel moritur ibidem (sive dicedat hyems abstet) vel de ferat sedem, si serenum nanciscitur./*
[cw: This]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$


\22. *Exsection ancient, but not profitable./*/ This way of taking, as appeareth, was anciently used in plentifull Countries, as *Greece, Sicily, Italy,/* &c. \23. *Neither first./*/But the former exsection, to wit, in the Spring, *Aristotle/* no where mentioneth: and surely it must needs doe more harme then good, seeing the Hives are then full of Schadons which being spild, spill their swarming; and the store of Honie, which they seeke for, is then well spent. 
\24. *Nor second./*/ And that also in the Autumne (which yet is the fitter time) seemeth no lesse unprofitable then troublesom: because the Bees, in the Spring following, if they lacke not Honie to live on, yet shall they lacke Cells to lay their young in, whereby their breed will bee hindered. And at neither time can it be done without much spoile of Bees. 
\25. *Specially for our Country./*/ But howsoever it faied with them, for our Country I take it to be verie unfitting. And therefore I say the lesse of it: referring the curious Reader unto the fifteenth Chapter of the ninth Booke of *Columella,/* and unto *Georgius Pictorious,/* who in his fourteenth Chapter writeth thereof at large. 

*The second part of this Chapter sheweth the trying of (1) Honie and (3) Wax with the (2) making of/* Meth *or/* Hydromel.

{T}HE hive being housed, *v:/* \*V.p.1.n.6./*/ squat it softly against the ground, upon the sides, not the edges of the Combes: and loosing the ends of the Spleets with your fingers, and the edges of the Combes, where they sticke to the sides of the Hive, with a woodden Slice; take them out one after an other. 
\1. *The Combes to be divided into three parts./*/ Then having wiped off the halfe-dead Bees with the Feather of a Goose-wing, breake the Combes presently, while they are warme, into three parts: the first sheere Honie and Wax, the second Honie and Wax with Sandarach, the third dry Wax without Honie. And that they may breake right where you would have them, marke the places deeply with the edge of your knife. 
\2. *Necessarie Instruments being first provided./*/ But first provide necessarie Instruments, as Panns, Kivers, Tongs, wide Sieves, or Wheat-ridders, a SLice, Knives, Straining-bagges, a Tub or Kieve, with a Tap, and 
[cw: Tap-waze,]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

Tap-waze, a hairen Clensieve,+ Honie-pots, Wax-moulds, Meth-barrels, &c.
+Treene vessels, if they leake not, are better than earthen: which if they breake not by some mischance, the verie force of the Honie is able to cracke. 
These things provided, take out the first Combe: and setting the Honie-end in a Ridder, resting upon Tongs over a cleane Pan or Kiver that will not leake; marke and breake off the first part for Honie, and leave it there: then going to the Kieve fitted with a Tap and Tap-waze, marke and break off the second part for Meth or Hydromel, and leave it there: and lay the third part aside for Wax. Then taking out an other Combe doe the like, &c. till the Ridder be full. 
\3. *The dressing of the first part for Honie in two shoots./*/ 
If you meant to make two shoots, and so two sorts of Honie; let your assistant presently cut the first part into thin slices, and, without any more adoe, let the Honie runne his first shoot. But this is to be understood of the darker part of the Combes: for the pure white Cells in the upper part (which containe nothing but pure white, or yellowish Live Honie) you may as well crush betweene your hands: and this will be fine ordinarie Honie. 
\4. *The first shoot for fine ordinary Honie./*/ But if, for some speciall use, you would have some Honie yet more fine and pure; then onely slice the purer part of the Combes, being yet warme with the temperate heat of the Bees, and so let the pure Live-honie runne through a cleane Clen-sieve. \4 *How to know good hony/*/ For, *In omni melle que per se sluit (ut mustum oleunque) appellaturque ac√¶ton, maxime laudabile est/*. \Nat. hist.li.II.c.15./ Of all Honie that which runneth of it selfe, (as new Wine and Oile) and is called +*Ac≈ìton/* is most commendable. 
This *Ac≈ìton/* or finest *Nectar/*, for his incorrupted puritie, is called Virgin-Honie. *Quod e favis sponte primum de fluit, virgineum mel vulgo appellatur./* Plantinus in Fernel.l.7.de Meth.Med.
\6. *Two sorts of virgin honie./*/ Whereof there are two sorts. The right Virgin honie is of a Swarme: *v./* \*V.c.n.29./*/ that which is of an old Stall, though it runne first and of it selfe, and were gathered the same yeare; yet being partly mixt with other, and laid up in corrupter vessels, not in the pure Virgin- Cells, *v:/* \*V.c.9.n.14./*/ is but a second or 
[cw: bastard]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

bastard Virgin-honie, rather to be called the finest ordinary. *v.c.6.n.30./*
+*Ac≈ìton/* without drosse or dregges. For [Greek] doth properly signifie *Cubilo/* a Bed, and is here used for Dregges, because the Dregges of Wine and Oyle and such liquors, are as a Bed or *Ground/* whereon they *lye:/* in which respect we also call them *Lees/* or *Grounds/*. But this *Metaphor/* to the Dregs of Honie is somewhat Catachrestical: because the Honie beareth his Drosse, and not the Drosse the Honie. 
\7. *Corn-hony got out by water or fire./*/ But the hard Corne-honie *v:/* \*V.c.6.n.27.&28./* in the top of the Combes, specially if there be any store, because it will not runne, uou must either wash into the warme Meth-liquor; or melt it with the Cells on a soft fire, or in a hot oven, or in *Balneo Mari√¶, v:/* \*V.p.3.n.7./*/ and so shall you have the Honie by it selfe, and the Wax swimming above it: which you may take away when it is cold. But so this good Honie will become but course: and therefore put it to the second shoot. 
Having now taken so many Stalls as you can dresse this evening, *v:/* take the rest as soone after as you may, *v:/* \*V.in p.1.n.4. V.ibidem./*/ and let the Honie be all tryed out, before you soake the second part. 
The Hives being rid, carrie them into your Garden (a Pearch at least from any Stall) for the Bees to take up your leavings: *v:/* \*V.c.8.n.13./*/ And have still by you a paile of faire water to wash your hands in: which water must be for the Meth.
When the Honie hath runne what it will; put this first shoot, whether it be ordinarie or Virgin-honie, into a picked bag, to straine it into his pot by it selfe. \8. *The second shoot for course Honie./*/ And let the remainder bee crusht with warme hands that it may runne againe for a second sort, which is likewise to be strained.

is to be strained. *v:/* \*V.n.7./*/ Then going to the Kive, slice off the second part (even all that hath Honie) for Meth. And set aside the drie part for Wax. And thus will your Honie be good enough: and such as, compared with the vulgar Honie, may well goe for fine. 
\10 *The vulgar Honie grosly handled./*/ For the Honie-men (because thus to cut each Combe into divers parts, and diversly to dresse each part, would be too tedious to them that have much to doe) doe use to make but one worke of all; with a thin light shovell pounding and compounding the Honie, and Wax, and Bees, and Schadons, and Sandarach all together. And then putting this confused stuffe into a strong hairen Bag, doe with a Presse or Wrenge violently wring out all that will runne. And this, having first his season of heat over the fire, they put up into barrells or other vessels to worke: whereby though it bee much purged, yet can it not choose but participare the nature and taste of those things wherewith it was so thoroughly infected. This done, the Pulse remaining in the Bagge they slice with a shredding-knife into a Trough or other vessel, and all-to-wash it and mash it in faire water for Mede: which, when the sweetnesse is all washt out, being crushed dry, the balls they try for Wax. 
\11. * The working of Honie, and how to helpe it./*/ Honie being put up into pots, will in two or three daies worke up a skum of Wax, Honie, and Drosse together: which being taken off with a spoone, put to the second part. In cold weather the Honie will not worke well without the heat of the fire. The best way is to put it into an oven after the batch is forth, but not before you can abide to hold your hand upon the bottom, for feare of over-heating the Honie. The next way is to stirre it in *Balneo Maria, v:/* \*V.p.3.n.7./*/ till it be all warme. 
\12. *Divers Countries yeels divers kinds of Honie./*/ The differences and degrees of Honie in goodnesse, are as well naturall as artificiall. For as it is made better or worse by the ordering and handling of it; so is it in it selfe better or worse, according to the different condition of the soile where it is gathered. *v./* \*V.c.6.n.31./* The Champain-honie is accounted almost twice as good as the Heath-honie, although they bee ordered both alike. For when the vulgar champian is sold

for nine pound the Barrell, the like Heath-honie will scarce yeeld five. And generally the finer the Wheat and the Wooll is, the finer the Honie of the same Region: *v./* \*V.p.3.n.4.&c.6.n.31./*/ and therefore no marvaile that the course Heath, hath as course Honie as Wooll.
*13. How to know good Honie/*/ Good Honie, when it hath wrought, hath these properties whereby it is knowne: It is cleere, odoriferous, yelow like pale gold, (but right Virgin-honie is more crystalline at the first, *v./* \*V.c.6.n.29/*/) sharpe, sweet, and pleasant to the taste, of a meane consistence betweene thicke and thinne, so clammie, that beeing taken up upon your fingers end, in falling it will not part, but hang together like a long string, as that useth to doe which is clarified. And such doth *Jacobus Sylvius/* describe the best honie, *Meloptimum sit purum adeo ut totum perluceat, odorum, flavum, acerrimum, dulcissimumque gustanti & jucundissimum, consistentia nec crassam nec liquida, sed tam sibi coharens ut continuitatem suam, quasi linea longissima, non intercisum servet, si digito attollitur: idem coquendo paucam spumam emittit./* And *Guil.Plantius. Mel probum est quod inter crassissimum & tennissimum, sit mediocre, sapore dulcissimum, & acerimum, simulque dulcedinis sensum inferens & vellicatu pungens linguam, colore pallidum aut subrutulum, & pellucidum, odoratissimum & recentissimum; quodque sublatum non facile ob sequacem lentorem abrumpatur, pondere grave, & inter coquendum spuma parum emittens./* In Fern. l.7.de Oxymel. 
\14. *Good Honie with standing waxeth hard and white/*/ This good Honie, specially that part which is in the bottom, will in time grow (like unto Corne-honie, *v./* in the uppermost part of the Combes) hard and white: such as is the Honie of + *Spaine/* and *Narbona/* in *France,/* which is accounted the chiefest, and compared with that of + *Hymettus/* and *Hybla./* But this is to be understood of ordinarie Honie: for the pure Virgin Honie will bee neither hard nor white; but changeth his liquiditie and crystalline cleernesse *v./* \*V.c.6.n.27.&.28./*/ into a thicke softnesse, and bright yelow colour.

\15. *The best of the Honie is in the bottome./*/ And alwaies the best part of all Honie is that which is lowest in the vessell. + For as the best oyle is in the top, and the best wine in the middle; so the best Honie is in the bottom. *Mellis exilior pars fluitat, qu√¶ eximenda est: pura vero & valida subsidit./* Arist.Hist.an.l.9.c.40. *In imo vase quod sidit, supernaturante pretiosius./*Plan.in Fern.l.7.de Oxymel.
+ As among liquours Oyle excelleth in lightnesse, and Honie in heavinesse; so in both that part is best, which excelleth in his excelling qualitie: and Wine being of a midling weight, is best in the middle. 
The weight of these three, one to an other, hath this proportion. Oile is not so heavie as Wine by one tenth part: for if you fill a measure with Wine, and divide it into ten parts; the same measure of Oile is no heavier then nine of them. And Honie is heavier than Wine by the halfe: for if you fill a measure with Wine, the same measure of Honie will weigh that and halfe so much more. *Quoniam Oleum levius est Vino parte + \+Ceu potius decima./ nona, Mel vero gravius Vino parte dimidia; queounque mensura capit Mellis uncias quindeciam, capit Vini uncias decem, & Olei novam./* Fern.Meth.l.4.c.6. 
\16. *The dressing of the second part for Meth./*/ THe second part of the Combes, appointed for Hydromel or Meth, you must first rid of the sandarach as neere as you can: cutting off that which is by it selfe, and + picking out that which is among the Honie: all which refuse, because of the wax that is with it, cast to the third part.
+If thus to part the Honie and the drosse shall seeme but a tedious piece of worke; you may leave it unto them that are expert in it *V.c.8.n.13./* And make your Meth of more meere Honie.  
\*How to make the Meth-iquor in two shoots./*/ And then, when the Honie is all strained, and put up; lay this second part a soake in milk-warme faire water, (that which commeth from heaven is counted best) in the Kive or Tub with his Tap and Tap-waze. But first wash the drie Combs therein, if any Honie chance to sticke unto them in the handling: then scrape and wash the Spleets, and lay them aside out of the way: and lastly, crush all the Pulse well betweene your hands, specially that which lieth lowest, and stirring is about all-to-wash it: and so let it steepe all that night.

In the morning let this first shoot of the Must or Woort, being made of his just strength, *v:/* runne through the Tap-Waze.  The Pulse which remaineth, when you have squeezed out the liquor, breake and wash in fresh warme water in the Kive, for a second shoot. When it hath lien a while in soake, first take those parcels that swim, and squeezing out the liquor +betweene your hands, lay the balls aside to the third part: (but let your Bees have the perusing of them) then take up those that lie in the bottome, and doe likewise: which because they have most Honie, you must take most paines in washing and crushing them. \*The second shoot./*/ And while this is doing, let this small liquor runne into a vessell by it selfe. When it is out, wash into it all the remainders of Honie *v:/* \*V.n.8./*/ adding some course Honie, if need be, to make it of his just strength: *v./* and then let both shoots run together through a +Clensieve into the Kive againe. And thus shall you lose none of your Honie.  
+If there be much Pulse, use a presse, when the liquor hath runne what it will. 
+The Clensieve is unto the Tap-waze for Methe, as the Strainer to the Ridder for Honie.*v:n.7./*
\18. *Two sorts of Hydromel, Mede and Metheglen./*/ *Meth/* or *Hydromel/*/ is of two sorts: the weaker and the stronger, *Mede/* and *Metheglen./*
\19. *When the liquor is strong enoug for Mede./*/ For the making of *Mede/*, if the Must, when it is all together, be not strong enough to beare an Egge the bredth of a two-pence abive it, then put so much of your course Honie into it as will give it that strength: which is sufficient for ordinary *Mede./* And afterward untill night, ever now and then stirre it well about the Kive. 
\20. *What proportion of water to hony./*/ If you would make a greater quantitie, then, must you adde a proportionable measure of water and Honie: namely six of that for one of this. The learned Physitian *Mathias de Lobel/* requireth this proportion of six to one to be boiled to foure. His receipt of Spices is Cinamom, Ginger, Pepper, Graines, Cloves, *Ana/* two drammes. The second morning put to the Must the scum of the Honie, stirre all together, and stoope the Kive a little backward. When it

hath setled an houre or two, draw it out to be boiled. And when you see the grounds beginne to come, stay; and let the rest (save the very thick grounds, which cast to your Bees) runne into some vessell by it selfe: which, when it is seded, peere out into the boiling vessell through the Clensieve, and cast out these grounds also into your Garden. 
\21. *How, and how long the Must must be boyled./*/ The Must being set over a gentle fire, when you see the Scum gathered thicke all over, and the bubbles at the side begin to breake it; having slacked the fire, to cease the boyling, skim it cleane. Then presently make a fresh fire to it: and when you see the second skum ready, having + slacked the fire againe, take it quickly away: then make to it the third fire, and let it boyle to the wasting of a fourth part, if it bee made of the washing of Combes; and to the wasting of one fift or sixt part, if it be made of cleane Honie: not ceasing in the meane space to take off the Scum as cleane as you can. One houres boyling may suffice: but if the MEth bee of cleane Honie, it may as well be done in halfe the time. 
+ In stead of twice slacking the fire, you may twice cool the boyling Must with cold Must reserved: or else be sure that it doe boyle all the while: onely at one side, and not all over. 
\22. *A receipt of Spices./*/After all this, put in the spices, *viz./* to a dozen gallons of the skimmed Must Ginger one ounce, Cinamom halfe an ounce, Cloves and Mace *Ana/* two drams, Pepper and Graines, *Ana/* one dramme, all grosse-beaten, the one halfe of each being sowed in a bag, the other loose: and so let it boile a quarter of an houre more. 
The end of boiling is thoroughly to incorporate the Boorne and the Honie, and to purge out the drosse: which being once done, any longer boiling is unprofitable; as diminishing more than the quantitie, than increasing the strength and goodnesse of the Hydromel.
\23. *How the Must is to be used when it is boyled./*/ As soone as it is boiled enough, take it from the fire, and set it a cooling: the next day, when it is setled, poure it out, through a Haire-sive or linnen bag, into the Kive: reserving still the Lees for the Bees) and there let it stand covered three or foure daies till it worke; and let it worke two daies, 
[cw: Then]

===

Then draw it into the Tapwaze, and tun it into a Barrell scalded with Bay-leaves, making the Spice-bag fast at the cap. If there remain much grounds, you may purifie them by boiling and skimming againe as before: but this will never be so good as the first: and therefore you may put it by it selfe, or with some remainder of the best, into a small vessell to spend first, before it be soure. If the *Meth/* be not much, you may tun it in the next day, and let it worke in the Barrell. Being tunned, it will in time be covered with a mother: which if, by jogging the vessell, or by other meanes, it be broken; the *Meth/* will turne soure. But so will it make excellent Vinegar, and the sooner, if it be set in the Sun: which the longer you keepe, the better it will be.     
\24. *The making of/* Meth√¶glen./ *Metheglen/* is the more generous or stronger *Hydromel:/* being unto *Mede/* as *Vinum/* to *Lora./* For it beareth an Egge the breadth of a groat or six pence: and is usually made of finer hony, with a lesse proportion of water; namely, foure measures for one: receiving also in the composition as well certaine sweet and holsome hearbs, as also a larger quantitie of spices: namely, to everie halfe Barrell or sixteene Gallons of the skimmed Must, Eglantine, MAjoram, Rose-marie, Time, Winter-favourite, *ana/* halfe an ounce; and Ginger two ounces, Cinamom one ounce, Cloves and Mace *ana/* halfe an ounce, Pepper, Graines, *ana/* two drams, the one halfe of each being bag'd, the other boiled loose. So that whereas the ordinarie *Mede/* will scarce last halfe a yeere; good *Methelglen/* the longer it is kept, the more delicate and holsome it will be: and withall the cleerer and brighter, according to the *Etymon/* of the name. *v. + in p.3.n.23./*
He that listeth to know the many and sundry makings of this holsome drinke, must learne it of the ancient *Britaines:/* who therein doe passe all other people. One excellent receit I will here recite: and it is of that which our renowmed Queene of happie memorie did so well like, that she would everie yeere have a vessell of it.  
\25. *The Queens/* Meth√¶glen./ First, gather a bushell of Sweete-briar-leaves, and a bushell of Tyme, halfe a bushell of Rose-marie, and a pecke of Bay-leaves. Seeth all these, being well washed in a Furnace of 
[cw: faire]

===

faire water: let them boile the space of halfe an houre, or better: and then poure out all the water and herbes into a Vate, and let it stand till it be but milk-warme. Then straine the water from the herbes, and take to everie+ six Gallons of water one Gallon of the finest Honie, and put it into the Boorne, and labour it together halfe and houre: then let it stand two daies, stirring it well twice or thrice each day. Then take the liquor and boile it anew: and when it doth seeth, skim it as long as there remaineth any drosse. When it is +cleere put it into the Vate as before, and there let it be cooled. You must then have in a readinesse a Kieve of new Ale or Beere, which as soone as you have emptied, suddenly whelme it upside downe, and set it up againe, and presently put in the *Meth√¶glen,/* and let it stand three daies a working. And then tun it up in Barrels, tying at everie Tap-hole, by a Pack-thread, a little bag of Cloves and Mace, to the value of an ounce. It must stand halfe a yeere before it be drunke.  
+If you marvell that so great a quantitie of water is required; it is partly because of the goodnesse of the Honie, which being pure and fine goeth further then ordinarie: and partly that it may have the longer time in boiling, before it come to his strength. And therefore some will have eight parts of water to one of Honie: but then they boile it so much the longer.+ The third part at least being wasted.
\26. *The dressing of the third part for Wax./*/ THE third Part consisting of wax and drosse, set over the fire in a Kettle or Caldron that may easily containe it: and poure into it so much water as will make the wax to swim, that it may boile without burning: and for this cause, while it is seething with a soft fire, stir it often. \27. *First boile it with water./*/ When it hath sod a while and is thoroughly melted, take it off the fire, and presently poure it out of the Kettle into a Strainer of thin strong Linnen, or of Twisted-haire, readie placed upon a Wrenge or Presse: and then winding and doubling the necke of the Bag, lay on the Cover and presse out the liquor as long as any Wax commeth into a Kiver of cold water, but first wet therewith both the Bag and the Presse, to keepe the Wax from sticking. At the first commeth forth most water, at the last most drosse, in the middle-most Wax.

\29. *Next make the Wax into Balls./*/ The Wax waxing hard, make into Bals, squeesing out the water with your hands. When you have thus done, presently while they are warme breake all the Balls in (2.) small Crumlets into a Skillet or Kettle set over a (3.) soft fire. \30. *Last of all melt it and cast it in a mould./*/ While it is melting, stir it and skim it with a spoone (4.) wet in cold water: and as (5.) soone as it is melted and skimmed cleane, take it off. And having provided the (6.) mould, first (7.) warme the bottome, specially if the cake be small, and (8.) besmare the sides with Honie, and then instantly poure in the wax (9) (being as coole as it may run) through a linnen straining-bag. When you come neere the bottome, peere it gently till you see the drosse comming: Which straine into some other mould by it selfe. And when it is cold, either trie againe, or having pared away the bottome, reserve it, as it is, for some use. 
When the Wax is in the mould, if any froth yet remaine upon it, blow it together at one side, and skim it off lightly with a wet spoone. 
\31.*And keepe the cake from cracking./*/ This done, set not the cake abroad, or where it may coole hastily upon, but in the warme house: and if it be great, cover the mould with a Plaster, as close as you can, to keepe the top from cooling, till the (10.) inward heat be alayed: and so let it stand, not moving the mould till the cake be cold. If it sticke, a little warming of the vessell or mould will presently loose it: so that it will slip out. 
(1.) So will they breake the smaller with lesse labour. (2.) That the wax may melt the sooner, and all together. (3.) For a rash fire will burne it, and change both colour and qualitie. (4.) That the skum sticke not. (5.) For over-heating will discolour the Wax, turning the bright yellow into a darke or reddish colour, not so commendable in Wax: for thereby it is knowne to have lost of his fastnesse and sweetnesse, and to be the worse for all uses. (6.) Which may be a bason or other vessell of mettall or earth, bigger upward than in the bottom. (7) Lest the Wax first poured in (which is the best) being presently cooled, lie beneath the drosse. (8.) To keepe the Wax from sticking to the sides of the mould, and consequently to helpe save the Cake from cracking. For Wax shrinketh in cooling, as new walles in drying: and therefore if the Cake sticke not, if shrinketh together from the sides, then must it needs cracke, one part shrinking from another (specially if it coole hastily upon) as it happneth commonly in great Cakes: For small ones, whose inward heat is 
[cw: alayed]

alayed by that time the upper part beginneth to harden, are not so subject to cracking. (9.) & (10.) For the great heat of the Wax doth cast up the watrie vapours mingled with it: Which so long as the upper part of the Cake continueth liquid, doe easily passe: but when it is hardened, and the Wax yet fervent hot beneath; the vapours being violent through the inward heat, must needs either cracke the Cake, or heave it make it hollow, or both, specially if it be verie great: for then will the heat be both stronger and longer: but this is helped by not sticking. *v. ante num./* (8.)
\32. *How to know good Wax./*/ The properties of tokens of good Wax are (1) most yellow, sweet, fat, (2) fast or close, (3) light, (4) pure, and void of all other matter. *Cer a sit flavissima, odorata, pinguis, coacta, lovis, pura, & aliena omni materia carens./*
(1) That is most light yellow, fardest from red, and neerest to white: for as in gold the deepest, so in Wax and Hony (*v.n./*13) the palest yellow is best: yea the pure Virgin-wax at the first is white. *v.c.6.n.14./* (2) not hollow as the froth is. (3.) For Wax, like Oile, is best at the top, as Hony in the bottom (*v.n./*15) except the hollow froth, which is to be skimmed away. *v.n.30./* (4) and therefore the bottom, unto which the drosse doth ascend, is not good.

\7. *Two waies to clarifie Hony./*/ Honie is clarified by boiling: and that either by it selfe, or else with a fourth part of water, or other liquor. But alwaies in boiling skim it, that it may be pure. 
By it selfe you must boile it untill it will yeeld no more skum, (which will be about halfe an houre) and that with a very soft fire, or in a + double vessell; lest, by overheating, it get a bitter taste, and lest it suddainly run over and flame. 
[The]

+The right skum, which is drosse, is short and brittle: which when it is cleane taken away, the force of the fire will cause the very Hony to rise up like a skum: but that will then be tougher and more clammy than the drossie skum, and so wil all the rest be, when it is cold, as being over-boiled: therefore be sure to take it off in time. 
+i. a vessell set in a vessell of boiling water, called, *Balneum Maria/* which is best.  
With water it is to be boiled an houre at the least, even untill the water be evaporated: *v./* \V.Fernel.l.4.c.15./ which thing is knowne by the bubbles that rise from the bottom: then, to make it more pure, put into every pound of Hony the + \*+Lesse white may serve, if the Honie be good./*/ white of one Egge, and afterward skim it againe in the boiling. The fire may be more fervent at the first; but toward the end it must be slacke: for it is then apt to be set on fire, as the meere Hony, and to become bitter with violent heat. 
The course Honie being boiled and clarified hath a pleasant taste, and is comparable for most uses to the purest bottom-honie being raw. 
Which pure Honie, if you be disposed to boile it, will aske lesse time to be clarified, as yeelding little or no skum at all: and in taste and vertue it is more excellent.
When your Honie is boiled enough, take it from the fire, and rather too soone, than too late: for if there bee any drosse remaining, you shall finde it in the top, when it is cold: but over-much boiling consumeth the spiritous parts of the Honie, and turneth. the sweet taste into bitter. 
\8. *The quintessence of Honie./*/ And such is Honie in his owne kind, both raw and boiled. It is also altered by distillation into a water, which *Raimundus Lullius/* that excellent Chymist calleth the Quintessence of Honie. This Quintessence dissolveth Gold, and maketh it potable: likewise any sort of pretious stone that is put therein. It is of much vertue, that, if any be dying, and drink two or three drammes therof, presently he wil revive. If you wash any wound there-with, or otherfore; it wil heale quickly. It is also good against the Cough, Catarre, and paines of the Melt, and against many other diseases. Being given for the space of six and fortie daies together to one that hath the Palsie, it helpeth him. Which thing

\10. *The making of it./*/ The making of is is after this manner. Take two pound of perfect pure Honie, and put it into a great Glasse, that foure parts of five may remaine emptie: +Lute it well with a Head and Receiver, and give it + fire until there appeare certaine white Fumes: which, by laying wet clothes on the Receiver and Head, and changing them when they are warme, will turne into a water of a red colour like blood.  When it is al distille, keepe the receaver close shut, and let it stand till it be cleere, and of the colour of a Rubie. Then distill it in *Balneo Mari√¶/* seven times; and so it will lose this reddish colour, and become yellow as Gold, having a great smell and exceeding pleasant. 
+The Lute may be made of Clay, Flocks, and Salt-water, tempered together; or of Meale and whites of Egges.
+The Lute being first dried in the Sunne or by the fire.
\11. *The vertue of Honie in Confections./*/ Now as Honie is good by it selfe, either altered or in his owne kinde; so is it also being mixt with many other Simples: which here to declare would seeme but tedious and impertinent. Notwithstanding it shall not be amisse, in two or three instances, to give you a taste of such Confections; and first of those that are inwardly, then of those that are outwardly received. 
Of the first sort are Marmalade, and Marchpane, preserved Fruits, as Plums, and Cherries, &c. Conserves of Roses, Violets, &c. with Syrups of the like matter. 
\12. *Marmalade made of Honie./*/ Marmalade is thus made. First boile your Quinces in their skins til they be soft: then, having pared and strained them, mix there-with the like quantitie of clarified Honie: and boile this together till it be so thicke, that in stirring (for you must continually stirre it for feare of burning) you may see the bottom; or, being cooled on a Trencher, it be thicke enoug to slice: then take it up and box it speedily. You may also adde a quantitie of Almonds, and Nut-kernels: also Cinamom, Ginger, Cloves and Mace, of each a like quan-

titie, pounded small and put into the Honie with the Quinces, and in boiling to be stirred together. This is very good to comfort and strengthen the stomack. For want of Quinces you may take Wardens, Peares, or Apples, and specially the Peare-maine, Giliflower, Pipin, and Roiall.
\13. *Marchpane./*/ Marchpane may be made after this manner. Boile and clarifie by it selfe, so much Honie as you think meet: when it is cold, take to every pound of Honie the white of an Egge, and beat them together in a Bason, till they be incorporat together and wax white, and when you have boiled it againe two or three walmes upon a fire of coles, continually stirring it, then put to it such quantitie of+ blached Almonds or Nut-kernels stamped, as shall make it of a just consistence: and after a warme or two more, when it is well mixt, powre it out upon a Table, and make up your Marchpane. Afterwards you may ice it with Rose-water and Sugar. This is good for the Consumption.
+Steepe them a night in cold water, and the peeles will come off.

\15. *Preserves/*/ 
*Preserve Fruits after this manner./* 
The Damascens, or other Fruit, being gathered fesh from the tree, faire, and in their prime, neither greene or sower, nor over-ripe or sweet, with their stalks, but cut short; weigh them, and take their weight in raw fine Honie: and putting to the Honie the like quantity of faire water, boile it some halfe quarter of an houre, or till it will yeeld no skum: then having slit the Damascens in the dented side for feare of breaking, boile them in this liquor with a soft fire, continually skimming and turning them till the meat commeth clean from the stone, and then take them up. If the liquor be then too thinne, boile it more: if in the boiling it be too thick, put in more faire water, or Rose-water if you like it. The liquor being of a fit consistence, lay up and preserve therein your Fruits.

\Melviolatun./ 
\16. *Syrups. Syrup of Roses/*/ After the same manner is made Conserves of Violets. Syrup of Roses make thus. Steep fresh Roses in hot water over the Embers, (the vessel being covered) untill the Roses wax pale: then straine out the Roses, and put fresh in their places, until they are also pale: this doe ten times, or untill the water be red. And this being purged with Whites of Egges, (to every pinte of liquor one) boile it gently with like quantitie of fine Honie, untill it be of convenient thicknesse. If you prepare it for present uses, the lesse boiling will serve: if you meane to keepe it, it requireth more, for which purpose the sunning of it is good: This purgeth a little, specially being new. *Sylv.Med.S.Mist.l.3./* 
Or thus. Steep one pound of Red Rose leaves in foure pound of water foure and twentie houres. When the water is strained, put unto it two pound of fine Honie, and boile it to the thicknesse of a Syrup, taking of the skumme as it riseth. It tempereth the hot affections of the braine, it quencheth thirst, it strengthneth the stomacke, it procureth sleep, and stayeth thin rheumes, *Fern.Meth.lib.7./* 
*Syrup of Violets/* The Syrup of Violets is made, after the same manner, of fragrant Violets, and steeped untill the liquor be blew. Being well boiled it may be kept a yeare without vinewing or corruption. It tempereth and purgeth hot and sharp humours; and therefore is good in a Pleurisie: it expelleth Melanchollie and the effects thereof, as head-ach, waking, dreaming, and heavinesse of heart: it is fit to be used before, and after purging. *Plantius in Fernel. meth.l.7/*

well for pleasantnesse in taste, as for health; so being burnt it is better than any burnt Wine, for comforting and setling of a weake and sicke stomach, and for recreating the naturall heat.
The manner of burning it (if you know not) may be this. First set on the fire a + deepe Skillet or Kettle, almost full of water: when it boileth, put in a Pewter pot full of *Meth√¶glen:/* before that beginneth to boile, skimme it and put in two or three bruised Cloves, and a branch of Rose-marie: then beat the yolke of an Egge in a dish, put into it a spoonefull of the *Meth/* cold, and stirre them together to keep the yolke from curdling: then put to that a spoonfull of the hot *Meth:/* and after that an other, and an other, alwaies beating them together: and then, some and some, put all into the pot, still stirring it about. Then as soone as it boileth, take up the pot, and, saving your hands harmlesse, powre it into another warme pot of like capacitie, firing it as it runneth: and so brue it till it will burne no more. A *Meth√¶glen/*-posset is of the like vertue. 
+The deeper the pot standeth, the sooner it boileth. You may, for a need, set the pot on the Harth in the midst of hot Embers: but take heed the flame melt not in the Pewter. 
\24. *The properties and vertues of naturall Wax./*/ Wax hath no certaine elementar qualitie, but is a meane betweene (1) hot and cold, and betweene dry and moist.

Moreover, it maketh the most excellent; light fit for the uses of the most excellent; for cleernesse, sweetnesse, neatnesse, to be preferred before all other: Which *Scaliger/* in his *√Ünigmatica,/* giving it the precedence, doth intimate.

When it hath boiled up twice or thrice, lift the vessell from the fire, and, the wax being presently cooled with cold water, take it out: and when you have scraped off the drosse, if any such hang on, and put it into other Salt water, seeth it againe. And having boiled up twice or thrice, as before, lift it from the fire againe. And then take the bottom of an other earthen pot, or a little round board with a handle in the middle like a Churn-staffe, but without holes: and having first wetted the bottom of it in cold water, dip it into the hot vessell, and assoone as this wet bottom toucheth the wax, pull it out againe, and you shall have sticking to the bottom a thin cake: which when you have taken off, wet the bottom againe, and dip it as before: and thus do till you have taken up all the wax in cakes. These cakes hang in the open aire upon a line drawne through them, so that they may not touch one an other, besprinkling them with water in the Sun-shine untill they be white.

But those that are smal, this oile healeth in 3. or 4. daies, by annointing only the wound therwith, and laying on a cloath wet in the same. It stayeth the sheding of the haire, either on the head or beard, by annointing the place therewith. 
Also for inwarde diseases, this Oile worketh miracles, if you give one drachme at a time to drinke with white Wine: for it is excellent in provoking urine which is stopped, it helpeth stitches and paines in the loines, it helpeth the cold Gout, or Sciatica, and all other griefes comming of cold.

This doe twice together, and let the Plasters remaine each time upon the place, untill the heat of the stomacke have dried them, and made them loose: which, in some that are much troubled with the wormes, will be within foure and twentie houred; although in some they will sticke a whole weeke together.
