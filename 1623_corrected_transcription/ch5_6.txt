##* Of the Swarming of Bees, and the/* Hiving of them./##


\1. *The parts of a swarme./*/ {T}He stocks having bred and filled their Hives do send forth swarmes. A swarme doth consist of all such parts as the stocke doth: namely of a Queene-bee, Honie-bees as well old as young, and Drone-bees. 
\2. *When you may see the Queene-Bee./*/ If any man desire to see the Queene, he hath now opportunitie, when she goeth forth with hir swarme: *v/* \*v.n./*34/ and dead ones he may finde many before the stooles, when the stocks have cast their last swarmes, *v./* \*v.n./*35./ and also when many meet in one swarme. *v.c./*1.*n/*7. But then, being dead and shrunke together by the force of the poison, they lose much of their stature and comlinesse. 
\3. *The swarme no younger then the stocke./*/ Men thinke that the swarme consisteth onely of young Bees, and that the old Bees only tarrie behinde: but indeed (though it may seeme strange) the swarme is no younger, than the stocke: for there are in both of both sorts. The young Bees remaine in the stock with the old for their defence, and for the greatest labours; *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*57./and the old ones go with the young in the swarme for their aid and guidance in their worke. 
The drones they take with them for propagation of their kinde. *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*3./ \4. *Many drones in a swarme a good signe./*/ And therefore those swarmes that have many Drones will surely prosper: and if they be rathe will swarme againe, unlesse they bee over-hived: whereas those that have few or none, will increase little or nothing all the Summer after. 
\5. *A kinde spring for swarmes./*/ A warme, calme, and showring spring causeth many and

rathe swarmes, though sudden stormes doe hinder them. *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*60./
*Augent mella siccitates, sobolem imbres./* \Hist.l.4.c.22./
+Dry weather makes plenty of hony, and + moist of swarms. But note that the chiefe time for breeding swarmes is the Spring, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*13./ and for honie-gathering the Summer: *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*38.39.*&c./*/ so that when a dry Summer followeth a moist Spring, the Bee-folds are rich. If the Summer be also moist, the increase of Bees will be greater: but, because of the scarcity of hony, this increase will proove a decrease: the more swarmes you have at the end of this Summer, the fewer stalls shall you have at the beginning of the next. For, except some faire rathe swarmes, and some good stockes, which cast betimes or not at all, they die all for hunger; when they have spent their own pittance, and spoiled their fellowes. How to prevent this poverty, see *note/* 11.&+ in 20. and to prevent the losse & spoile that would come thereof, take the light stocks, together with the small and late swarmes, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.&iii.&iiii.*in n./*3./ feed the midling sort, *v./* \*V.c./*8.*n./*5./ and be sure they be not over-hived.*v.n./*45.
+The reason is, that in hot and drie weather the hony dewes are raised, and the adventitious moisture is drained from the flowers, the pure naturall juice onely being leaft in them: of both which they gather all the day long without interruption.  
+The reason is, that the weather keeping them in, they can doe nothing but breed and hatch their schadons: and when they goe abroad, they bring in grosse Bee meat, *Ambrosia/* and water, wherewith to feed them; but can finde nothing fit to lay up in store. So that moist weather gives them two causes of swarming, plenty of Bees, and penury of hony: the one makes them able, the other willing: and then neither winde, nor cloud, nor raine can stay them. Whereas in times of plenty it is other-wise. *v.n./*20.
\6. *Swarming weather./*/ Likewise, in warme and calme weather the swarmes delight to arise, but specially in a heat-gleame, after that a showre or gloomie cloud hath sent them home together: in extreme hot and dry weather not so: *v/* \*V.n./*20/ in so much that stalls being full and ready to swarme with the first, are sometime so kept backe with cold dry windes in *Gemini,/* and with extreme heat and drought in *Cancer,/* that they have not swarmed at ali that yeere.
\7 *The swarming houres./*/The swarmes use to come forth betweene the houres of 
[cw: nine]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

nine and three, and sometime an houre sooner or later: but chiefly betweene eleven and one. They choose rather the fore-noone, if the weather please them: otherwise they will stay for a faire houre in the after-noone. This time of the day therefore, in the swarming months, your Bees must continually be attended.
\8. *The two swarming moneths./*/ The swarming moneths are two, *Gemini/* and *Cancer/*: one moneth before the longest day, and an other after. 
In some very backward yeres, such as was 1621.& 1622. there have bin swarmes a weeke in *Leo/*, which did well, (the Bramble, that was wont to be a fortnight or three weekes rather, *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*39./ not blowing before that time:) Likewise in warme Countries in a kinde Spring, some have come somewhat before *Gemini/*, but this also is rare.
\9. *Rathe swarmes./*/ Those that come before the Solstice, in the ascending of the Sunne, are rathe swarmes. 
\10. *Late swarmes./*/ Those that come after, in his descending, are late swarmes. But there are few that come in the first fortnight, and they very good: few also in the last fortnight, namely after *S. Peters/*-tide, and they all as bad: unlesse the backwardnesse of the yeere, when it happeneth, doe mend them. 
Note heere that in the Heath-countrie, swarmes are usually lateward, namely in the latter part of *Cancer/* and the forepart of *Leo:/* which some yeeres prove better then the rathe. 
Those that swarme before the blowing of knap-weed, come in very good time, before the blowing of blackberies, *v./* \*V.c.6.n.39./*/ they may live and doe well, but blackbery-swarmes, specially castlings, are seldome to be kept, as being more likely to die then to live: and if they live, they seldome swarme the next yeere. \11. *Blacke-berie-swarmes are seldome to be kept./*/ And moreover they weaken the stocks from whence they came, which otherwise would swarme betime: and then one such swarme is worth three of those lateward ones. Wherefore put such backe againe into the stocke: which you may easily doe, so soone as they are hived, by knocking them downe upon a table close to the doore: their fellowes that are behinde will soone be in with them. And if they rise againe, serve them so till they cease. But if you spie them rising before the Queene be come forth; shut them in a while, and that will stay them.

\12. *A prime swarme and an after-Swarme./*/ A good stocke doth naturally and usually cast twise; a prime swarme, and an after-swarme: specially if the prime swarme be so rathe, that the castling may come before the bramble-buds be open: yea and rathe prime swarmes not over-hived, \13. *A stall may cast foure times./*/in a plentifull yeere may swarme once or twice: although some full stalls doe not cast once, some but once, and some having many princes (specially when the prime-swarm is broken) doe cast three or foure times. \14. *Divers causes of breaking the prime swarme./*/ For sometime it happeneth that, in the swarming, a blacke cloud rising stayeth part of them that are alreadie come forth, and lie about the hives-doore: sometime when they are all up, either fearing a cloud, or disliking the lighting-place, or being troubled in the hiving, part doth returne.
\15. *One prime-Swarme is worth two after-Swarmes./*/ One prime-swarme is worth two or three after-swarmes, except it be broken: and then if the residue come forth in one entire swarme, that after-swarme may bee the better of the twaine: but if it be divided into two or three, then will they all be but indifferent: such, except they be timely, or united, *v./* \*V.n./*67.&68./ can hardly live till the next Summer.  
\16. *The vulgar Bees appoint the rising of the fore-Swarmes, & that upon 4. grounds./*/ The choice of the time when the first colonies, or prime-swarmes shall goe forth, the rulers referre unto the commons: who by reason of their continuall travell and businesse both without and within, doe best knowe when all things are readie and fit for them: First within they will be sure that they have a Prince ready to goe with them: for without a Governour they will not be, *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*6.&7./. Then that their Hive be full, so that it may be divided at the least into two or three sufficient companies: one to remaine with *Marpesia/* the old Queene, an other to go forth with *Antiope/* the Prince, and a third haplie, which, together with the unripe brood in the celles, maie make an other swarme to serve *Orythia/*. Without likewise they will see, first that the flowers be in state presentlie to furnish them with store of wax and hony: then that the weather do please them, as being warme and calme, & moist: unlesse, being continually unseasonable, they have no choice. *v./*+.*in n./*5. 
\17. *Five signes of the first swarming./*/ When the Hives begin to be full, they will dronie, or yeeld forth fledge-drones: *v./* which is a signe that the first 
[cw: brood]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

brood of nymphes have beene a good while flying abroad, and are now able to endure both weather and labour. 
Other signes of the Hives fulnesse and readinesse to swarm are at the Hive-doore, First, the Bees hovering in cold evenings and mornings. Secondly, the moistnesse or sweating upon the stoole. Thirdly, their hasty running up & downe. Fourthly, their first lying forth in foggy and sultrie mornings & evenings, & going in again when the aire is cleere. 
\18. *The signes of present swarming./*/ When they will swarme, sometime they first gather together without at the doore, not onely upon the Hive, but upon the stoole also: where when you see them begin to hang one upon another in swarming time, and not before, and to grow into a Cluster that covereth the stoole in any place; (specially if there be Drones among them) then be sure they will presently rise, if the weather hold. The first that come forth wil increse that Cluster to some fourth part of the swarme: and then begin they to flie away, first out of the Hive, and after from the Cluster. But commonly some few of them doe first flie forth and play to & fro the Hive-doore, so to till out more company unto them: and when by this meanes they have gotten out so many, that you may see them begin to dance *v/* \*v.n./*34./ above the Hive; then doe they hastilie issue forth and swarme.
But heere you must note, that as to fill the Doore, or to lie forth a little now and then in foggie or sultrie mornings and evenings, (which is because then they are most offended by heat within, and can best indure the aire abroad) and otherwise to go in againe, is a signe that the Hive is full, and therefore ready to swarme; \19. *To lie forth continually is a signe they will not swarme./*/ so to lie forth continually (as in extreme hot and and dry summers they use to doe) under the stock or behind the hive &c. (specially after *Cancer/* is come in) is a signe and cause of not swarming. For the Bees, knowing by nature that the greatest companies doe prosper best, until they finde themselves so pestred with heate and throng of multitudes, that the Hive can scarce hold any more, will have no mind to swarme: and when they have once taken to lie forth, the hive will alwaies seem empty, as though they wanted company. 
\20. *The causes of their lying forth./*/ One cause of their lying forth, us stormie and windie wea-

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

ther, not suffering them to swarme when they are ready: for when their number is growne so great through their continuall breeding, that the Hive cannot hold them, seeing they may not swarme, they must needs, for want of aire & roome within, lie without: which when they have once caught, they will hardlie leave: and the longer they lie out, the lother they are to swarme. 
An other cause of their lying forth, is continuall hot and drie weather, specially after the Solstice: which causing plentie of hony both in plants and dewes, their mindes are so set upon that their chiefe delight;
*(Tantus amor florum, & generandi gloria mellis)/* \*Virg./*/ that they have no leisure to swarme: although they might most safelie come abroad in such weather, which would not suffer the weakest Nymph to fall.
And when by continuance of such honie-weather they are once sufficientlie provided, they will then be loth to leave the sweet fruits of their labours, and to change their full store-houses for that which makes giddie House-wives. But if they have once begun a combe without where they lie, the matter is out of doubt. Whereas contrarily in wet and scanty Summers, no weather will stay them from swarming as soone as they are readie: although by that meanes (unlesse they be rathe, or the weather sodainelie mend) most as well of the stockes as swarmes are like to die for hunger: *v./* \*V.n.5./*/ and therefore, as neere as you can, so + order the matter, that your swarmes may come betime. For rathe swarmes and their stocks, that have the summer before them, prove alwaies good.
\21. *The remedy and meanes to make them swarme./*/ First keep the Hive as cool as may be, by watering and shadowing both it, and the place where it standeth: and then enlarging the doore to give them aire (alwaies provided that there be no backe-doore in the shadie parts of the Hive) move the cluster gentlie with your Brush, and drive them in. 
If they lie forth and swarme not; (though they have had fit weather two or three daies) then the next calme and warme day, betweene 11. and 1. of the clocke, or within an houre sooner or later, (when the Sunne shineth, and you see 
[cw: no]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

no clouds comming to hide it) put in the better part, at the least, of them that lie out, with your Brush; and the rest gentlie sweep away from the stoole, not suffering any to cluster againe. These rising in the calme heat of the Sunne, and flying about before the Hive, will make such a noyse, as if they were swarming: which their fellowes hearing, will happlie come forth unto them, and so begin to swarme. 
If this doe not serve, but that returning to the Hive they lie forth againe, then reare the Hive high enough to let them in, and cloome up the skirts all but the doore.
But if notwithstamding all this they doe not swarme; then assure your selfe that either they have no Prince bred to goe forth with them, or else they are fat and full of honie, which they are resolved not to leave. 
\22. *What is to be done to those that by no means will swarme./*/ And then it be before Mid-*Cancer/* & the hony-weather hold; your best way is to double the stall, by turning the skirt of the Hive upward, and setting a leere prepared Hive fast upon it: into which they will ascend, and worke and breed there as well as in the old. *v/* \*V.n.24./*/ In the end of *Virgo/* drive them all into the new Hive, (which then, if the weather have held good, will be full of wax and hony) and take the olde for your labour. But if Mid-*Cancer/* and the hony-dewes be past, (because they want time and meanes to store the void Hive) let them stand: such a stall will be verie good to be taken; or, being young, to be kept. *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*3./ But first replenish some over-swarmer with his excesse or lying out (specially if you meane to take him) thus.
\23. *How to replenish an over-swarmer./*/When all hope of their swarming is past; in some evening (while is it yet light) holding a Hive under those that lie out, cut them off from the stoole with a+ tight thread: \+Held straight betweene two hands./ and carrying them to an over-swarmer that you would mend, knock them downe on a Table close before his Hive: into which, because they come without a Prince, they are quietly admitted, and quickly united under one common Commander. 
\24. *How to double a stall./*/ The manner of doubling a stall is this: Having first measured the Hive about in the largest place, provide a leere spleeted Hive of the same size and compasse: make ready also two square stickes 13. or 14. inches long; and an inch thicke at one end, and halfe an inch at the other: these two
[cw: sticks]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

sticks lay parallel over the hive five or six inches apart, and each of them a like distance from the middle of the Hive, with both the thicke ends one way to size out the doore for this doubled stall: and so tie them with needle and thread to the skirts fast in their places. These stickes doe also serve to keepe the Hive from slipping, and so save the Bees, that otherwise might be prest to death betweene the two skirts. Then in a faire night, so soon as it is dark, reare the full Hive with three bolsters, two on the West side, and one on the East, some foure or five inches high, (or with a double rest) to let the Bees in: and cover both it and the stoole with a large Mantle. Then make a Brake behinde the stoole of foure stakes, 2. two foot, and 2. foure foot long, pitched fast in distance equall, and fit to conteine the full Hive, being of the same compasse. One of the short stakes set close to the middle of the backe of the stoole, the other Northward opposite to it: one of the long ones on the West part, and the other on the East. Then right in the middle, betweene the stakes, digge a hole in the ground halfe a foot deepe; and of such compasse, that being halfe filled with a wisp of straw, it may fitly receive the top of the Hive, and so the Hive may stand upright and fast in the Brake. Then pare away the inner edges of the tops of the short stakes, and the Hive in the setting downe may not stay against them: and taking up the West-stake, sticke it to you.
These things thus prepared, your selfe standing on the West side of the Brake, and your assistant on the same side of the stoole at your right hand, (both in your complete harnesse) *v:/* let the assistant take hold of the Hive, &, yeelding the top toward his breast, reare the fur-side of the skirt from the East-bolster. When you see it fitting, embracing the hive as neere the skirt as you may, lift it up sheere from the other two bolsters, and set it downe warily in the middle of the Brake, with the top in the hole as upright as you can, and the doore to the backer part of the stoole, that it may stand South-ward as it did before. And presently let your assistant, being readie, place the leere prepared hive even upon it, with the thick ends of the stickes South-ward: and doe
[cw: you]

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

you put the long stake into his place againe. Then cloome the Hives together with rolles, flatted, that none of the cloome fall in among the Bees, leaving open the space betweene the sticks ends for the new doore of this double hive. Lastly put on the hackle, and gird both it and the long stakes to the leere-hive, about the middle with a Belt, and about the top with a With. And so let them stand till after the end of the *Dog-daies/*, when Bees are taken. *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*1./ But in no case let the doing hereof be deferred beyond the time prescribed, *v:/* \*V.n.22./*/ lest you have little or nothing for your labour. 
\25. *How to drive all the Bees into the new hive, and so to take the old./*/ At the Vindemie, in a faire calme morning before any Bees be abroad, shut up close all the stalls in your Garden: and those that stand next cover with sheetes and blankets, lest some of the younger sort mistake, and tarrie at their doores till they be chilled. And when the Sunne is an houre high, and the aire waxeth warme, having first parted the new Combs and the old with a long knife, take off the upper hive or *Receiver,/* & set him upon the stoole in the old place: BUT be sure, &c. *as it followeth,/* *c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*15. If you see the *Receiver/* be very fat, or feare the Queene be hurt, or not in the *Receiver/*; your best and safest way is to take them both: for if they be over-fat or want a Ruler, undoubtedly they will not prosper. 
\26. *The signes of after swarmes/*/ The signes of the after-swarmes are more certaine. For whereas the rising of the prime swarme is appointed by the vulgar, whose chiefe rule is the fulnesse of the Hive; the Hive being now well emptied, for other swarmes there needeth some other direction, \27. *The rising of the after-swarmes is appointed by the Rulers./*/ which the Rulers themselves doe give by their voices: without which that stocke will swarme no more that yeare. And yet the choice of the houre, yea and of the day among foure or five is permitted unto them, as best knowing the disposition of the weather. 
\28. *The Bees Musicke./*/ When the prime swarme is gone (if the stocke shall cast any more) the eighth or ninth evening after, sometime the tenth or eleventh, the next Prince, when she perceiveth a competent number to be fledge and readie, beginneth to tune in hir treble voice a mournefull and begging note, as if she did pray hir Queene-mother to let them goe. Unto which voice if the Queene vouchsafe to reply, tuning hir 
[cw: *Base/*]

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

*Base/* to the young Princes *Treble/*, (as commonly she doth, though sometime scarcely intreated in a day or two) then doth she consent. And therefore, unlesse foule weather stay with them till it bee too late, *v:/* you may assuredly looke for a swarme. Which seldome ariseth the next day, although the weather be verie pleasant; or the next day, unlesse the weather bee verie pleasant: but after the third nights warning, they will accept indifferent weather, such as the prime swarmes will not come abroad in. And as the Queenes voice is a grant, so hir silence is a flat deniall: the Proverbe heere hath no place, *Qui tacet consentire videtur:/* For without this Concent there is no Consent. 
\29. *The Princes part./*/ This song being contained within the compasse of an *Eight/* from *C-sol-fa-ut/* to *C-sol-fa/*, the Prince composeth hir part within the foure upper Cliefes *G, A, B,/* and *C/* usually in triple moode, beginning with an odde *Minim/* in *G-sol-re-ut/*, and tuning the rest of hir notes, whereof the first is a *Semibriefe/*, in *A-la-mi-re./* Sometime she taketh a higher key, sounding the odde *Minim/* in *A-la-mi-re/*, and the rest in *B-fa-b-mi./* Sometime, specially toward their comming forth, she riseth yet higher to *C-sol-fa/*, holding the time of three or foure *Semibriefes,/* more or lesse. Now and then shee beginneth in duple time some two or three *Semibriefes/*, but alwaies endeth with *Minims/* of the triple Moode.
\30. *The Queenes part./*/ The Queenes part, contained within the foure lower Cliefes, consisteth of *Minims/* altogether in triple moode; commonly in *Fa-fa-ut,/* sometime in *C-sol-fa-ut,/* sometime in the other two *Cliefes/* betweene them: continuing hir tune the time of nine or ten *Semibriefes/* more or lesse.
\31. *The other Ladies parts./*/ Sometime a third Princesse imitating the Queenes voice in time, though differing haply in tune, joyneth with them, the more, with their full noise, to incite the swarme to goe, that hir turne may come the sooner. And sometime a fourth also interposeth hir *Minims/* to fill up the Quire. But none dare counterfeit the voice of the chiefe Prince, for that were treason to hir person (and yet sometime one of them, in hope to part the swarme, will steale out with hir:) which, if the swarme be not parted, or being parted be put together, costeth her hir life *v:/* \*V.c./*1.*n./*7./ as well as the lives of some of hir fol- 
[cw: lowers.]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

lowers. Notwithstanding each of these, when hir elder sister is gone, and hir turne next, changeth hir note, begging in *Orithyas/* tune leave to be gone too: which as sometime the Queene granteth unasked, beginning first hir selfe; so sometime by hir silence she denieth, though mournfully intreated: and then the swarme tarieth, and the poore Ladie must die. 
With these various and harmonious notes, answering one an other, and some pawses betweene, they goe solemnly round about the Hive, so to give warning unto all the company. This they continue daily untill their swarming: but you may heare them best evenings and mornings. Which Musicke as it cannot please and delight them that listen to it; so must it be most sweet and pleasant to the young Prince hir selfe, unto whom therby is proclaimed a Warrant, not onely of hir life, but of a Kingdome also: both which otherwise she were sure to lose.
\32. *In the Bees song are the grounds of Musicke./*/ In this *Melissomelos,/* or Bees Madrigall, Musicians may see the grounds of their Art: first their *Moodes/*, sometime the *triple/* or *imperfect/* of the more, sometimes the *duple/* or *imperfect/* of the lesse: then the tunes of the six notes, *ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la/*; whereof the Queene soundeth the first foure, and the Prince the other two, together with the doubling of *fa-sol/* in two higher Cliefes, to make up the full *Eight:/* and lastly the six Concords, an *imperfect Third/*, a *perfect Third/*, a *Diatessaron/*, a *Diapente/*, a *Sixt,/* and a *Diapason/*. And if any man dislike the harshnesse of the *Seconds/* and *Sevenths/*, which now and then hit among them; he sheweth himselfe no experienced Artist, which knoweth not that as well in *Musick/* as *Oeconomick/* there must sometime be Discords: yea and that in either they have had their laudable use, as serving to make sweet Concords the sweeter. So that if *Musicke/* were lost, it might be found with the +*Muses/* Birds. 
The severall parts of whole Song comprizing these mentioned notes, with pauses interposed (as I have at severall times by a Winde-instrument, whose notes can neither rise nor fall, attentively observed) I thought good heere to prick downe, that you may see them in all these particulars of their Naturall Art. Onely I cannot altogether warrant the Conclusion: because in that confused noise, which the buzzing Bees in the busie time of their departing doe make, my dull hearing could not perfectly apprehend it: so that I was faine to make up that, as I could. But I am sure, if I misse, I misse but a little.

\33. *Before swarming the voices come downe to the stoole./*/ In the morning before the swarme come abroad, these Ladies come downe neerer the stoole: and there they hold on their melodie somewhat longer, singing sometimes above twentie notes together, and with shorter pauses.
\34. *The manner of their swarming./*/ At the very swarming time they descend to the stoole: where answering one another in more earnest manner, with thicker & shriller notes, the mainie begins to march along; thronging one another for haste, and buzzing with their winges in great jolitie.
As soone as those gallant Nymphs are aloft, they doe most nimbly bestirre themselves, sporting and playing in and out as if they were dancing the Hey; in this manner waiting for the comming of their Prince. Now when some two third parts or three fourth parts of the swarme is passed, the Musick ceaseth, and +then commeth forth this stately Dame *Orythia/*: who walking a turne or two before the doore (of purpose, you would thinke, to be seene) she takes hir leave, leaving but a small traine to follow her: which high them after as fast as they can. 
+Sometime when ill weather hath kept in the swarme over long, shee will come forth before them, as it were checking their slacknesse and timiditie: but then returning in, she commeth forth afterward in hir due place.
This decent order the great Lords of the earth seeme to have learned of this little Ladie: who in their Country progresses, goings to Parliament, and other solemne processions, doe send the greatest and fairest part of their retinew before them, having behinde but a smale troope of necessarie attendants to gard their persons. 
\35. *The prime swarme being broken, the next may call and swarm within the eighth day./*/ If the prime swarme be broken, the second will both call, and swarme the sooner; it may be the next day: and by that occasion haply a third also may arise, yea and sometime a fourth.
But all within a fortnight after the prime swarme.
\36. *All the swarmes of one hive come within a fortnight./*/ Except in some extraordinarie plentifull yeares both for Breed and Honie. Such was 1616. wherein not onely many swarmes did swarme as old stockes; but also old stockes having betimes swarmed twice, about six weekes after began to swarme a fresh, as in an other yeare: and so had, in effect, two Summers in one.

After the second swarme, I have heard a young Ladie-bee call: but the Queene, not willing to part with any more of hir companie, did not answer: and the next day she with seven more were brought forth dead. *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*7./
Sometime though the Queene give consent to a third or fourth, the Bees seeing the stock little enough to live, shew themselves loth to goe: and then also there is no way with her, but one. 
\37. *What use there is of tinging the swarme./*/ When the swarme is up, and busie in their dance, *v:/* it is a common use, for want of other Musicke, to play them a fit of mirth with a Pan, Kettle, Bason, Candlesticke, or other like Instrument, so to stay them, forsooth, from flying away. Indeed where other Bee-folds are not farre off, this use hath a good use: for thereby the place and time of their rising is publikely notified, and so a just and open claime laid unto the Swarme, that otherwise some false neighbour might challenge for his: which undoubtedly was the originall cause of this custome. But the pretended reason is to me a meere fancie: although I know it to bee as ancient as common. For *Claudian/* long agoe could say, 
*-------------Cybeleia quassans
Hiblæus procul æra senex revocare fugaces
Tinnitu conatur apes.------------/* \De 6.consolatu.Honorii./
And before him *Virgil,/*
*Hinc ubi jam emissum cave is ad sidera cœti
Nare per æstatem liquidam suspexeris agmen, &c.
Tinnitusque cie, & matris quate cymbala circum:
Ipsæ confident medicatis sedibus, ipsæ
Intmia more suo sese in cunabula condent./* \Georg.4./
And before him old *Aristotle/*,
*Gaudere etiam plausu, & sonitu apes videntur. Quapropter tinnitu æris aut Fictilis convocari eas in alveum aiunt. 
 
\38. *What to doe if a swarme be way-ward./*/ If you see them begin to flie aloft (which is a token they would be gone) cast dust among them to make them come downe. If they be not stayed, but, hasting on still, goe beyond your bounds; the ancient Law of Christendome 
[permitteth]

But sometime they flye so fast and so farre before they pitch, that though you follow them never so fast, you must be content to leave them, happily to the happy finder. For when you have lost the sight and hearing of them, you have lost al right and propertie in them. 
*Examen ex alveo tuo evolaverit, eousque intellegitur esse tuum, donec in conspectu tuo est, nec difficilis persecutio eius est: alioquin occupantis est./* Justinian.l.2.institutionum juris tit.de rerum divisione./*
\39. *Some swarmes provide them houses aforehand./*/ Sometime they wil be provided of a house before they swarme, which some Harbingers have found and viewed, and dressed against their comming: as either a hollow tree, or a void Hive: and then will they away presently, and by no meanes settle till they come thither. \40. *And then they fly away directly to the place./*/ Unto which place they will flie, not, as at other times, uncertainely this way and that way: but as directly as they can guesse. 
A poore Woman having taken a poore swarme to keepe for halfe, by New-yeares-tide lost hir owne part and hir Partners: and being carelesse of the Hive when the Bees were dead, she let it stand abroad till she had forgotten it: The next Summer comming into hir Garden, she found some Bees passing to and fro hir Hive, which were then busie in clensing and dressing it: she wisely fearing that the Bees came to carrie away the Wax that was leaft, bade hir Daughter take the Hive and carrie it in: The Wench following hir play did happily forget hir mothers command: and by that meanes the Hive stood still, till the unexpected swarme came, that afterward stored hir garden. It is not amisse therefore to follow the counsell of *Columella:/* \41. *Vacua alvearia stent semper parata in Apiario./*/ *Oportet autem vacua domicilia collocata in apiarijs habere. Nam sunt nonnulla examina quæ cum processerint, statim sedem sibi quærant in proximo (Seu potius prius quæsitam, lustratam, & paratam ad eant.v.n.39.) eandemque occupent quam vacuam reperint./*

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

\42. *The Hiving of Bees./*/ {W}Hen your swarme hath made choice of a lighting place, you shall quickly see it knit together in forme (if nothing let) of a +Cone, Pine-aple, or cluster of grapes. As soone as it is setled, or at least as sone after as may be, hive them. \43. *When they are to be hived./*/ For the longer they hang, the lother they are to be put from the place, the more time they lose from their worke, and the more in danger are they to be gone, either home againe, or quite away. \+A Cone is a round *Pyramis. Figura rotunda ex lato in acutu definens:/* and therefore is a Pine-aple, of his figure, called *Conus./*/ 
For when they are once setled, they presently send forth spies, to search out an abiding place: who if they returne with good newes before swarming-time be past that day, they rise presently, and are gone: otherwise they will stay till swarming-time the next day. \44. *The token of their flying away after they be setled./*/ But whensoever the spies have sped, they returne with all speed, and no sooner doe they touch the Cone or Cluster, but they begin to shake their wings like as the Bees doe that are chilled: which the next perceiving doe the like: and so doth this soft shivering passe as a watch-word from one to an other, untill it come to the inmost Bees: whereby is caused a great hollownesse in the Cone. When you see them doe thus, then may you bid them farewell: for presently they begin to unknit, and to be gone. And then though you Hive them never so well, they will not abide. 
\45. *How to fit the Hives to the swarmes./*/ When you see your swarme, first choose out a fit hive, neither too big nor too little, but proportionable to the quantitie and time of the swarme: so that the Bees may fill it that yeere, or the least within a handfull, which they may make up the next yeere in good time.
A swarme before *Mid-gemini,/* put into a Hive that conteineth twice so much as the +swarme is: A swarm at *Cancer,/* into a Hive that conteineth so much, and halfe so much: and for a swarme at *Mid-cancer,/* a Hive, that will hold it or little more, may suffice. The rest betweene these let be fitted in like proportion unto these. 
For example, a swarme of three gawns, of a +good Prime-swarme before *Mid-Gemini/*, will aske a Hive of three pecks: such a one at *Cancer/*, a Hive of five gawnes. Likewise a double-prime swarme comming betime, is fitted with a bushell-Hive: and all pecke-swarmes, and other single 
[cw: swarmes]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

swarmes after *Mid-Cancer/*, with the least, or halfe-bushell-hive, *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*6./ But little and late swarmes are rather to be united.*v./* \*V.n./*67.&63./

+The aire being sultry-hot, causeth the swarme to hang hollow, and so to seeme greater than he is. 
+The goodnesse or greatnesse of a swarme you may most certainelie know by the weight: it being a good one that weigheth five pound, a reasonable good one that weigheth foure, and a very good one that weigheth six. Hereby also it will not be difficult, which seemeth impossible, to know what number of Bees is in a swarme; if you know first that 4480.is a pound, because 280. weigheth one ounce, as 35. one dragme. So that two good swarmes united weighing 10.or 11. pound, doe conteine betweene 40. and 50. M, the number of a Campe Royall: which company cannot wel be larger under one Leader, in the largest Hive.*v.c./*3.*n./*6. Of such a number did *Alexanders/* victorious Army consist. For *Diod.Sic.l./*17. reckoneth up some 48.M. with those 13500. leaft behind with *Antipater./* And *Justin.l.9./* not mentioning this company, numbreth 36500. which number is also great enough for a very faire swarm; as conteining the quantity of two reasonable swarmes united: there being also few single swarms so good, as to amount to 30000. 
The weight of any swarme is to be knowne when the Bees are newly hived, and the number in any weight when they are newly taken.

If this just proportion be not precisely kept, the Bees may doe well enough in a middle-sized hive: for being under-hived, they will cast somewhat the sooner, though peradventure the lesse swarme in good time; and being but a little over-hived, though they spend some time in supplying the former yeeres defects, they may yet swarme in good time, and the fairer swarme. And indeed all swarmes, whether bigger or lesse, by decreasing or increasing, doe naturally draw towards this quantity. 
But if the disproportion be much, it must be amended; whether you spy your error the same day, or afterward. 
If the same day, your remedy is to knocke out the Bees upon the mantle betweene two single Rests, and to set a fitter Hive over them: but this is not to be done before the swarming-houres be past, lest some of the Bees take a miffe and goe home againe. Otherwise you may set the Hive in a Brake, *v./* \*V.n.24./*/ with his bottome upward, and the fitter Hive upon.
If afterward you see the Bees lying out, that they are 
[cw: under-]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

under-hived, your remedy is to reare the Hive with a skirt, or Bolsters, as much as will let them in. If at *Virgo/* you see, by their not filling the Hive, that they are over-hived; your remedie is then to cut off the skirt unto the combes, or neere to them.
\46. *Better to under-hive a stall then to over-hive him./*/
But generally it is safer and more for your profit, to under-hive a swarme, than to over-hive him.
\47. *Three things requisite to hiving/*/ Your Hive being fitted and dressed, *v./* \*v.c./*3.*n./*8./ you must have also in readinesse a Mantle, a Rest, and a Brush.
The Mantle may be a sheet, or halfe-sheet, or some other linnen cloth, an ell square at the least. 
A Rest is either single or double. The single Rest is a *Prisme/* or three square *Columne/*, eighteene inches long, and three inches deepe, having the upper edge full of nicks for the space of six inches at each end, and the middle space, of six inches, smooth. It will be safer for the Bees, and lighter for cariage, if the length of tenne inches in the middle of the bottome be cut away one inch high, abating the new edges; and the foure inches at each end be hollowed in the middle of the bottome from end to end, at the same height of one inch: an so this will be the forme of the side, 

{diagram}

And this of the end. It is most fitlie made of a quarter of a young tree. {diagram}

Upon shelving or hanging ground, one single Rest may serve: but if the ground be somewhat levell, it is better to use two: because the Hive-skirt is set down upon them with lesse danger to the Bees, then upon the ground or other flat thing. And these two Rests are to be placed with the upper edges about nine inches apart: so that the Hive standing upon them, may hang out over them some two or three inches 
[cw: In]

===  
 
$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

In some cases two single Rests are most convenient, *v./* \*V.n./*45.56.69./ but in most the double: *v/* \*V.n./*57./ which is also lighter for carriage, and more ready for use. 
\50. *The double Rest./*/ The double Rest consisteth of two parts or sides, an inch thicke, of the same length and depth with the single Rest, having such upper edges so nickt at both ends, and the lower edges smooth, with ten inches of the middle cut away halfe an inch high, and then made sharpe againe which two sides are to be fastned one to another, at the just distance of nine inches from edge to edge, with two Rounds or Braces tennanted into them three or foure inches from the ends. These sides are fitly made of inch-board, or of a cleaft Lug of Withie or other wood. 
\51. *The Brush./*/ The Brush is a handfull of Rosemary, Hyssop, Fennell, or other herbes; of Hazell, Withie, Plum-tree, or other boughs; or rather of boughes with hearbs, bound taper-wise together. 
\52. *What the Hiver must doe./*/ All things necessary thus prepared, let the Hiver, which must weare no offensive apparell, *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*27./ first drinke of the best beere, and wet his hands and face therewith: and then let him goe about his businesse soberly and gently, taking good heed where he sets his foot, and how hee handleth them: for if he tread upon a Bee, or by any other meanes crush one of them; they presently finding it, by the ranke smell of the poysonous humor, will be so angry; that he shall have worke enough to defend himselfe, unlesse he have on his complete harnesse: *v/* \*v.c./*1.*.n/*40./ and being thus disquieted they will be the worse to hive. Moreover, the troubling of them doth oft times make them rise and goe home againe: sometime it breaketh the swarme, causing part to returne, whereby the rest are discouraged, being least unsufficient: yea somtime it disperseth and spoyleth the whole swarme: it may be also the death of the Queene: and then they will not continue to the next Summer, howsoever provided. And experience hath taught me, that few swarmes much troubled in the hiving do prosper. And therefore in any case Hive them as quietly, and with as little businesse as you may. 
\53. *The manner of Hiving./*/ The manner of hiving is so manifold, by reason of the 
[cw: many]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

many & different circumstances of the lighting or pitching places, that it can hardly be taught by precepts; but is rather to be learned by use and experience, guided with reason and discretion. Neverthelesse for the helpe of novices, I will set downe some speciall directions, which he that marketh, may readily hive a swarme in most lighting places: and a little practise will fit him for any.
\54. *Foure meanes of Hiving a Swarme./*/ First therefore note that a swarme is to be hived by 1.shaking, or 2.cutting the bough whereon it hangeth, or by 3.wiping the Bees down, or 4.driving them up into the Hive. 
\55. *How to Hive a Swarme that lighteth upon a bough./*/ If your swarme lighteth upon a bough; first spread the Mantle under it, and lay the Rest or Rests in the middle thereof, with the ends toward two corners of the Mantle. 
\56. *Either high./*/
Then if the swarme be so high, that you or some assistant may conveniently put the Hive under it; having first removed the twigs round about, that stand in your way, shake the Bees into the Hive: and when you have set the Hive right upon the Rests, take up two corners of the Mantle at the ends of the Rests, and pinne them together upon the top of the Hive, to stay the Bees running out sodainely: and then returning to the bough, shake it againe, and turne it aside out of his place, or cover it with your body, or with some cloth: and then presently loose the corners of the Mantle, and spread them againe. When they begin to cease running into the Hive, if you see them lie thicke upon the Mantle, shake them to the Hive-skirts: and the rest, as well upon the Hive as the Mantle, drive in gently with your Brush. So shall you easily and quietly Hive them. Otherwise having first taken away the twigs that may let you, cut off the bough or boughes (for sometime they wil hang upon many): and if you doubt that some of them may fall in the cutting, let another second you with the ready Hive, holding it directly under them. The bough being cut, lay the *Cone/* betweene two single Rests, and set the Hive over them. Or else put the *Cone/* first in the Hive, and then set the Hive downe upon the Rests. 
\57. *Or low./*/
But if they hang so neere the ground, that you cannot conveniently put the Hive under them; then placing the 
[cw: Mantle]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

Mantle and Rests right under, shake them downe: and setting the Hive over them upon the Rests, take up the two corners of the Mantle, and doe as before. 
And in case some of the swarme be first fallen to the ground, whence they make no haste to rise againe; then, placing a double Rest without a Mantle as well as you may, not killing any Bees, either shake the rest downe to them, and so set the Hive over them all, or else set the Hive over that part, and the rest, having cut the bough, lay beside the Hive, and move them with your Brush. 
\58. *How if it light upon a high tree./*/ If they pitch upon a high tree, it is best not to shake them into the Hive, but rather with a sharpe knife cut the bough if you can conveniently: and either put it into the Hive, and cover it with a Mantle, or bring it downe gentlie in you hand. But if you want a ladder or other meanes to bring it downe, then let it downe by a cord tied to some crooke of the bough. 
\59. *How if upon the body of a tree./*/ If they pitch upon the body of a tree, or upon some great arme; then set one side of the Hive right over the Bees, and with the Brush drive them up by moving still the lower and wayward part. But if you have no meanes to fasten the Hive by tying it above, or propping it beneath with prongs or the like, or if they be unwilling thus to take the Hive;  then parting them from the tree with a tight *v./* \*V.n./*23./ thred, wipe them downe into the hive, and set them upon the Mantle & Rest under the tree. IF they be so high that you must clime for them, then cover them presently with a Mantle, and so carry them downe. But looke that many will rise againe: which let alone untill they be knit, and then sweepe them likewise into another leere Hive, and put them to their fellowes. If yet some of them will up againe, you must not cease to trouble them, by wiping them off gently with your Brush, by laying on Mug-wort, Margerom, Wormewood, +Archangell, \+*White Nettle./*/ or other Weeds, or Hearbs, or by covering the place with a cloth: and after a while they will all to their fellowes in the Hive. 
But if they be so neere to the ground, that you cannot conveniently put the Hive under them; then with a tight thred 
[cw: sweep]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

sweep them downe upon the ground, having first layed the Rest either with or without the Mantle, and set the Hive over them.
And if they be of that distance from the ground, that you may set a stoole close under them; then make fast one side of the Mantle unto the tree close under the Bees, and the rest of the Mantle lay upon the stoole with the Rest: then having sodainly swept downe the Bees upon the Mantle, set the hive over them: and presently loosing that side of the Mantle from the tree, lay it over the Bees close to the Hive. 
\60. *How if it light upon the top of any thing./*/ If they light on the top of a stub, pollard, dead hedge, or the like, set one side of the Hive over them, propping the other side with a prong or two, and drive them up as before. 
\61. *How if it light in the middle of a dead hedge./*/ If they light in the middle or bottome of a dead hedge, your best way is softly to unworke the hedge till you come to them: otherwise you must violently knocke the hedge on the other side, so forcing the Bees into the Hive: and then setting them downe, trouble the place as before. But then be sure to be troubled your selfe: for it is hard to get them from such a hold. 
\62. *How if it light on some hollow side of a stub, or tree./*/ If they light on some hollow side of a stub or tree, which they wil be loth to leave; beware in any case you wet them not: for that doth not onely drowne many, but also maketh the rest more eagerly keepe the place: because some through the wet cannot flie away, and their fellowes finding them there will still resort unto them. But when you have moved them by other meanes as much as you may, put some morter or cloome in the hollow place, moving it forward by little and little so that you burie none of the Bees, untill you have spread it over the place: and then they will forsake that, and take some other part of the tree or stub, where you may more easily hive them. 
\63. *How if it flie into a hollow tree./*/ When they flie into a hollow tree, so that by none of the foresaid meanes you can hive them, then must you remove them by some offensive smoake, and make them chuse a new lighting place: which is thus to be done. If the Bees lye above the hole where they went in (as they will doe if they may) then boare a hole above them: if beneath, beneath 
[cw: them:]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

them: but be sure that the upper hole bee wide enough: rather than faile make two or three with a two-inch auger, or, with a hatchet, one as great. Then fire a peece of Match, or for want of Match, take a little Hay, or other thing that will smoake moderately, and not flame; and put it into the tree beneath them: and you shall see them fly forth above for life, and presently pitch in some place where you may hive them. But this is to be done the same or the next day at the farthest: for afterward they will abide the smother, and rather lose their lives then leave their goods. 
\64. *How if it light upon another hive./*/ If a swarme by reason of the coldnesse of the aire, and roughnesse of the wind being not able to get away, do offer to light upon any other Hive; quickly cover the Hive close with a Mantle, lest the Bees entring be pittifully murdered. 
\65. *The swarme is alwaies to be kept together, lest the Bees kill one another./*/ But in all manner hivings this one rule is generall. The swarme must bee continually kept together: for if at that time part remaine from the company but the space of halfe an houre or lesse; afterward when they finde them, and would returne unto them, they are used as Strangers and Robbers: as fast as they come they are beaten and killed. And those that escaping thence goe back to their old home, finde no better entertainment: and those few that escape thence, desperately runne into any other Hives, and so leape out of the Frying-pan into the fire. And therefore when the swarme is hived, if you see part begin to gather together by themselves; remove them as speedily as you can, that they may goe to their fellowes in time. 
\66. *The swarme to be set neer the lighting-place./*/And alwaies if you may chuse, set the swarme in the morning Sunne, and as neere the lighting-place as may be: which if some inconvenience will not suffer you to doe, yet set it within the length of a Pearch, or at the least within sight and hearing: and then (lest those which are leaft at the lighting place, by losing their company a while, lose their lives also) first trouble them by the meanes mentioned. *n./*59. and then cause some of the hived part to arise by shaking them off the bough, and by wiping them downe that are on the out-side of the Hive. Which, when they are up, will make such a noise, that their fellowes may easily finde them. And 
[cw: if]


=== 

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$
if any yet hankering behinde chance to be set upon when they come to the Hive, be-sprinkle the Mantle, the Hive, and the Bees with a little strong drinke, and you shall part the fray. 
And if any man marvaile why they of the same swarme shoulde so soone be strange one to another, seeing that Bees of one Hive being pent a whole day in an other, are yet welcome to their fellowes at the last; I can give no other reason but this, that they knowing a swarme may part, and so each part become a severall company, they deeme these to be such by their long absence. And if you aske why they should finde so hard entertainment in their old home from whence they came, it is because they went away with a Leader of their owne, and so became a severall company. And therefore if she bide away, as many as come backe (unlesse they come presently) are used as strangers: but if part have brought hir home againe, the rest do safely returne afterward, either that evening, or the next morrow.
\67. *What to doe if a swarme part./*/ If the swarme part, as sometime it will, and settle in divers places so neere that they may see each other; let the greatest part alone, specially if it bee best to hive, and trouble the other in the setling with shaking, gentle rubbing with weeds, and spitting and blowing in the place, that they may goe to their fellowes. If they bee setled and hang upon a bough, cut the bough and bring them to them. If they bee setled in some other place, then put them in a hive without Spleets: and if they bee within a pearch of the other part, move them both, one towards an other by little and little they be close together. After they have stood so about halfe an houre, lift up the spleeted hive from his Mantle and Rest, and shake the Bees out of the unspleeted hive upon the same: you may first knocke the hive downe, and then presently clap it twise or thrice betweene your hands. This done, sprinkle both parts with good drinke, and then without any stay set the spleeted hive over them, and they wil straight way up into it. But lay the unspleeted hive along hard by, not where it stood, but on the other side: and those that remaine in it will follow their fellows. But if the parts 
[cw: be]

=== 

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

be farther a-part then a Pearch; then put them together the same night, as if they were two swarmes. *v.n.69./* 
In like manner, when you have little swarmes under the quantitie of a Pecke, specially after *Cancer/* is well entred; put two or three of+ them together, whether they rise in the same day, or in divers. 
+After this time, the chiefe breeding being past, the swarmes desire most to unite themselves, that thereby they may make their company sufficient: which by breeding they have not time to doe. 
\68. *Uniting of swarmes is profitable./*/ For being thus united they will labour cheerefully, gather store of wealth, and stoutly defend themselves against all enemies: whereas if they were kept asunder, they would surely perish the next robbing-time, or winter; or hiving would doe you little good. And therefore if two swarmes rising at the same time do weld and knit togither; (as lightly they will doe, if they be within hearing one of an other) never trouble your selfe to part them, nor to be sorrie for the chance. For those two being all one, are better then three such that are alone. Indeed sometime it falleth out, that they fall out, and fight at the first: but that is because they are yet divers companies under divers Commanders. For so soone as the inferior being taken away, there remaineth one supreme Monarch over all; the strife presently ceaseth, and they are thence-forth linked in perpetuall peace and unitie together. Wherefore they are little acquainted with the nature of these politike creatures, that fetch their similitudes from them, to crosse that Rich, Mighty, Renowmed, thrice happy UNION, under one Prudent, Potent, Peacefull, thrice Noble Souveraigne.
\69. *The manner of uniting./*/ The way to unite two swarmes is this. In the evening some two or three houres after Sunne-set, or when it waxeth darke, having spread a Mantle on the ground, neere unto the stoole, where this united swarme shall stand, and set a paire of Rests in the middle of it; knock downe the *Remover/* upon the Rests, and then lifting up the Hive a little, and clapping it betweene your hands to get out the Bees that sticke in it, lay it downe on his side warily by the Bees, and set the 
[cw: *Receiver/*] 

===

=== 

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

*Receiver/* upon the Rests over them: and they will begin presently to ascend. If those that remaine doe not runne out to their company, of their owne accord; clap the place where they be gathered, and force them out: and lay downe the hive againe so, that the small remnant may follow their fellowes: if you spy any clustering by themselves, or stragling from the Rests, guide them thither. And when they are all in, either that night, or betimes in the morning, cloome the Hive unto his stoole. 
\70. *Another way./*/ Otherwise about ten a clocke, or as soone as it is darke, soe the *Remover/* in a Brake *v:/* \*V.n.24./*/ with his bottome upward, and the *Receiver/* upon him, binding them about the skirts with a long Towell or two Napkins sowed or pinned together, and so let them stand till the morning: and then set the *Receiver/* upon his stoole. After this manner I united two swarmes without death of any one Bee, saving onely her that must not be saved. 
If there be not Bees enough in the Hive, you may in like manner put another swarme to them.
\71. *Two speciall inconveniences to be avoided in this worke./*/ In the uniting of swarmes, two speciall inconveniences are to be avoided. The one that being united, they exceed not the naturall quantitie of a swarme: *v./* for if they doe, though they agree and gather, and grow fat, yea and cast the next yeare a faire swarme; yet will they never come to their first quantitie againe, nor scarse swarme any more in that vast roome. The other that they fight not, and destroy one an other. \72. * 1.Superfluous multitude./*/ \*V.c./*3.*n./*6./ \73. 2.*Civill warre./*/ Unto which two inconveniences the swarmes that unite themselves, if they be not aided, are obnoxious. \74. *To prevent the first./*/ To prevent the fruitlesse concourse of more then need is, which is the first inconvenience, when you see a sufficient faire swarme abroad, have an eye unto the rest of your stockes: if you espie an other about to rise, stay him by present shutting the doore with a Napkin, Apron, or other such cloth, untill the first swarme be setled: if then one rising draw neere unto him (as lightly he will doe if he can finde him) cover him quickly with a Mantle till that be setled: if being now hived, an other presse into him; then before many be entred, (that you may be sure not to have the Queene) 
[cw: carrie]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

carrie away the Hive with the swarme about two pearches off: and set a leere prepared Hive in his place for that other swarme. 
If none of these things bee done, but that swarmes doe runne together in greater quantitie than a good Hive can conteine; then reare the Hive with bolsters high enough to let them all in: which, when they have once swarmed, the +next Vindemie take away thus. 
+If you doe it in Winter, see the Bees be not chilled.
In a faire afternoone, about foure a clocke, picke away all the cloome betweene the hive and the stoole: and in the morning, at the breake of the day, lay the Hive along with the edges of the Combes up and downe, upon a Mantle spread on the ground: and there pare off the Combes ends even with the skirts, and so set him againe on the Stoole upon moveable *v:/* \*V.c./*3.*n./*29./ Doore-posts, and a thin bolster behinde: and presently clome up the Hive as close as may be. 
\75 *To prevent the second/*/ Concerning the other inconvenience, know this, that though two strange swarmes, with their severall Queenes, doe never meet in one Hive without discontent; (which they expresse by running to and fro without, and making a tumultuous noise within: from which they sometime fall to fighting and killing) yet commonly this strife is soone at an end. For the first Queene having gotten the right of the whole Roome by the possession of the Capitol or Superior part, where she sitteth safe with hir Guard about her; the Inferior by a common consent, is straight-way dispatched: and so they become all fellowes and friends under one Soveraigne. And therefore when swarmes are united by you, be sure that the Bees in the *Receiver/* be not throwne downe among the other, lest the Superior Queene come downe with them, and so you make more strife than needs.
\76. *When most danger./*/ But the danger is when two Princes with their equall Colonies happen to be equally advanced in the Hive: and therefore neither yeeldeth to other, but fight it out on both sides with equall hope of victorie. When this chanceth, which is very seldome, the Controversie is doubtfull; and the conflict like to be perillous, or rather pernicious, if it be

not prevented. In this case you have no other way, but the next morning, if still they fight, to cast them all out of the Hive: and so will they either knit apart, or returne to their old stockes: from whence another time they may swarme more luckily. The six and twentieth of June, 1621. \77. *A storie of a deadly feud./*/ I had two faire swarmes up at once, which going together over-filled a good Hive: where neither of them yeelding their Queene to the other, the fight continued full two daies and two nights, even from Thursday noone till Saturday in the afternoone: wherein such havock was made, that the better part of these brave Souldiers (a mournfull spectacle) lay some dead, some halfe-dead sprawling on the ground. At the last it was my hap to spie one of these Queenes at the Hive skirts in a Cluster: which taking up, now, quoth I to one that stood by me, heere is shee for whose sake all this slaughter was made: about an houre after my sonne found the other dead on the ground. When they had thus mercilessly murdered both the Queenes, and the better part of the swarmes; they that escaped rose all out of the Hive, and went into another swarme which stood behinde them: of which, because they brought no Ruler with them, they were quietly received. 
\78. *The causes of a swarme going home againe./*/ Sometime a swarme being abroad, yea knit in the *Cone,/* will not abide, but returne home againe: the cause whereof is windie, wet, or cloudie weather, the not finding of a fit lighting-place, trouble in hiving, the hot standing of the Hive without defence, and the missing of their Prince. And this specially in a plentifull season, they being then as readie to returne upon little or no occasion, as loth to come abroad, even in the safest weather. *V.n./*20. I observed once, that the Prince being scarce ready, fell downe from the stoole unable to recover hir wings: whereupon the swarme returned. She being put up into the Hive, the next day the swarme rose againe and setled, but the Prince hapned to fall beside the *Cone/*. The swarme being knit, missing her, began to unknit, and be gone: which I perceiving presently hived them: but they bein still discontented, ranne up and downe the Hive, with a murmuring noise both without and within. Anone

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

I had espied about a handfull of Bees hanging upon a Nettle on the ground: among which was the Prince. When I had cut off the Nettle, and set it by the Rest under the Hives-kirt; presently the knot unknitting, I saw the lost Prince with hir long traine stately walking into the Hive. As soone as shee was entred, these Male-contents began to stand still and buzze, joyfully shaking their wings, as they wont to doe when they are pleased; and so quietly kept the Hive. To see the suddaine alteration among them presently upon hir approach, and how they could have notice of it all at once, as well they without, as those within, would even make a man to wonder; but that indeed all they doe is nothing else but wonders. 
\79. *How to stay them./*/ Swarmes that goe home, doe sometimes stay long before they rise againe: and when they rise (specially if they were hived) they are likely to fly away: although I have knowne a swarme to rise foure times in three daies, and at the last to be quietly hived. If therefore you perceive the swarme returning before many be entred the old stocke, shut the doore fast: if that will not serve the turne, carrie the old stocke away stoole and all, and set the swarme presently upon a stoole in his place. 
\80. *How to keepe them from other Hives./*/ And if anie of them be going into other Hives, (as sometimes, where the Hives stand neere together or are many, some of them, specially the young Nymphs that have not beene abroad before, will doe; *v./*) \*V.c./*2.*n./*17./ cover them with Mantles: for as many as enter will die, or scape narrowly. 
\81. *Set not a swarme neare an others hiving-place./*/ IF a swarme light neere the place where another was hived a day or two before; be sure to set it as farre as conveniently you may, from the place where the former lighted and stood: the space of a Pearch or somewhat lesse may suffice: other wise many of the first swarme resorting thither, will to the new swarme, and so be killed.

\82 *What to do when the swarme is now hived./*/ When your Bees are hived, those that hang on the outside, drive in gently with your Brush, and lay the corners of the Mantle that are farthest from the Rest, over the Hive, with boughes also to shadow it, if the weather be hot. But if you finde them unwilling to goe in (as in extreme hot 
[cw: weather]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

weather they will be, though they like the Hive well enough) then strive not with them; but laying the corners of the Mantle over the Hive, as before, with boughes to shade it, there suffer them till the heat be abated, and then drive them in: and if you thinke they cannot otherwise well endure that heat, cover the Hive againe with Mantle and Boughs. And so let it stand till it wax darke, and all the Bees be come home. 
\83. *How to remove it in the evening./*/ Then knitting the foure corners of the Mantle together, at the top of the hive, and binding the Mantle about close to the middle of the hive with a small line, carrie the swarme to his place. \84. *How to set it on his seat./*/ And after a while, taking away the Mantle, set it upon his seat with the doore toward the South, or rather South-west: *v./* \*V.c./*2.*n/*.15./ and then leaving only a breathing place, for feare of stifling them, cloome it up close, & put on a hacle *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*15.*&/*20.&c./ and so let it stand till it be faire and warme the next day. For if the Hive be leaft open; in the morning betimes they wil resort to their former standing and there abide, sometime flying about, sometime setling on the ground: where if the cold or wet take them many dye. \85. *How to use it in the morning./*/ When you see the weather fit them, then hanging the Mantle, or other white cloth upon the Hive, let them go. But they will the sooner leave the haunt of their hiving-place, & fal to their work; if you shew them their new standing by knocking them out together upon the stoole, when the weather is warme.  
All swarmes, if the morrow be faire, will desire to be abroad betimes: and knowing their want, will bestirre themselves more lustily in their labour than other Bees. \86. *Foule weather the first day doth much discourage a swarm./*/ But if the foule weather keepe them in the first day, then are they much discouraged: so that the next day being indifferent, when other Bees worke hard, they will scarce looke out of the doore, not daring to commit their leere and thinne bodies to the could aire. And if they be quite kept in the second day also; then will they not wagge (though they dye for it) untill the weather be very pleasant. \88. *A swarme may live six daies without Honie./*/ They may live five or six daies in the Hive without Honie: but afterward they begin to string downe, hanging at an others heeles. *Pedibus connexæ ad limina pendent./* \Virg./ Which is a certaine signe

of death, if they be not presently relieved. 
\89. *How to prevent the drouping and death of a swarme./*/ To prevent this evill, If the swarme light in your Garden within a Pearch of the Seat that is appointed for him, set it there at the first: and so will they lose no time in hankering about the hiving-place. And if it light farther off, (whether in your garden or other place where they may stand safe, specially the weather being unkinde or unconstant) leave them there till it mend. *v:/* \*V.c./*9.*n./*2./ for those that are not removed, but keepe still their first standing, because they are not to seeke of their way home, they feare the foule weather as little as the best. And therefore need not to be shut in in the morning, as those that are removed: or to have any white over them for their direction. 
\90. *How to secure a drouping swarm./*/ The meanes to recover such a drouping swarme is this. The first Sunne-shinie day turne up the Hive to the Sunne, that his heat may revive them: and besprinkling the sides of the Hive, the Spleets, and the Bees also a little with Mede or Honie-water; hold them so in the heat of the Sunne till you see many of them fly abroad. Then set downe the Hive gently upon his Seat againe, and cover it not til it be through warme, and the Bees play cheerefully, as at other Hives.

\1 *Bees most industrious creatures./*/
{U}Nto the industrious nature of Bees nothing is more odious then sloth and idleness: while there is matter to worke upon (unlesse they be let by unkinde weather) their worke never ceaseth: yea the old Bees, which have spent their daies in continuall labour, will not at the last allow themselves any immunitie or rest in their Hives, as a recompence 
[cw: for]

for their paines past, but continue still their travaile unto death: *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*58./
\2. *In three months they cannot worke./*/ In the three still moneths indeed, *Sagittarius, Capricornus/* and *Aquarius/*, because then there is nothing to gather, they worke not: (yet when a faire day or houre commeth, as wearie of rest, they will abroad, imploying themselves in divers necessarie offices: *v./*) \*v.c./*3.*n/*60 61./ but so long as any good flowers grow, even from *Pisces/* or a litle before unto *Sagittarius/* and, some yeares, somewhat after, (which is full nine moneths) they lose no time, (*Nullus, dum per cœlum licuit, perit dies/*) \3. *All the yeare after they lose no time./*/ but follow their businesse tooth and naile. \Nat.hist.l.11.cap.6./ \4. *Three fruits of Bees labour./*/ Which incessant labour while the time permitteth, with the three singular effects thereof, the (1) working of Wax, the (2) making of Honie, and the (3) feeding of their young *v:/* \*V.n.53./* Virg./ the Poet in few words hath elegantly expressed all together.  
*Quod superest, ubi pulsam hyemem sol aureus egit/*
*Sub terras, cœlumque, œstiva luce reclusit;/* 
*Illæ continuò saltus sylvasque peragrant,/*
*Purpureosque metunt flores & flumina libant/*
*Summa leves. Hinc nescio qua dulcedine lætæ/*
(3.) *Progeniem nidosque fovent: hinc arte recentes/* 
*Excudunt/* (1.) *ceras: &/* (2.) *mella tenacia fingunt./*

\5.*The first, and ground of all, is Wax./*/ Their first worke is the ground of the other two, the Artificiall Cells serving both for Coffers to lay their sweet measure in, and for neasts and nurseries to breed their young in. The matter thereof they gather from flowers with their Fangs: which, being kept soft with the heat of their little bodies, of the Aire, and of their Hives, is wrought into Combs. This worke is so nimbly and closely done, that it can hardly be perceived: insomuch that *Aristotle/* plainely confesseth, *Nec vero quemadmodum operantur visum adhuc est./* \His.l.9.c.40./ But *Plinie/* willing to goe a little beyond him, telleth us a tale of a Lanthorne-hive made at *Rome/* through which, forsooth, their doings in the Hive were discried: and in another place of another like device. *Multi alvearia speculari lapide focêre, ut operantes intus spectarent./* \Nat.hist.li.11.c.16./ \Nat.hist.li.21.c.14./ But unlesse the Bees also were transparent as well as the Hive, this cannot be: seeing they doe alwaies frequently compasse the Combs

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

round about. A more likely way than that, were to have a moveable peece in one side of the Hive: which when you have taken away, you may see the Drones and the Hony-Bees walking together to and fro, and with their doubled heat hatching their young: but their worke can you not see; though you remove and part the Bees till the bare Combes appeare. \7. *How you may see the working of the combes./*/ But if your curiositie would so faine behold the manner of their curious and artificiall building, the onely way is this. In *Gemnini/* set up a last yeeres midling swarme two or three handfulls above the stoole and then when most of the Bees are abroad (but most fitly in the forenoone when they are most quiet) you may behinde the stoole behold them working on the edges of their combes: and having blowne their liquid and soft wax out of their mouthes (as the Waspes doe their drossie stuffe, which you may see them gather from pales with their fangs and so carry it away) to fasten and fashion it with their fangs and forefeet. 
\8. *How much wax they bring at once./*/ How much wax they bring at once, doth appeare by the new swarmes: whose first weekes worke is spent chiefly in building combes: wherein they are so earnest, that it falleth out with them as it is in the Proverbe, *The more haste the worse speed./* For many of their burdens doe fall from them before they can fasten them to the Combes. You may then see great store of them upon the stoole by the skirts of the hive, like unto the white scales, which fall from young birds feathers. And therefore some have imagined, that they also are scales which the young Bees doe likewise shed from their wings. But put you some of those parcells together with warme fingers, & you will quickly be resolved of that doubt. 
\9. *The admirable Architecture of their combs and cells./*/ The Bees combes are placed otherwise then the Waspes: for the Waspes hang theirs one under another, and the Bees theirs one beside another; beginning them in the top of the hive, at that distance that a Bee may reach from one to another. 
Their cells or little holes are made six square, according to the number of their feet: and of that length and widenesse, that each of them may easily containe a Bee. Which are so artificiallie wrought and joined together, that *S. Ambrose/* in the consideration thereof saith. \Hexamer.l.5.c.21./ *Quæ castra quadrata tantum 
[cw: possunt]

===

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

possunt habere artis & gratiæ, quantum habent crates favorum, in quibus minutæ ac rotundæ cellulæ connexione sui invicem fulciuntur? Quis enim architectus eas docuit hexagonia illa cellarum indiscreta laterum æqualitate componere, ac tenues inter domorum septa ceras suspendere, stipare mella, intexta floribus horrea nectare quodam distendere?/*
But heerein their Art is yet more exquisite, that whereas there are two courses of cells in the two sides of every comb, the cel-bottoms in these two sides are never opposite one to an other: but each hexagonial bottom of one side answereth to three third parts of the hexagonial bases of three contiguous cells on the other side, meeting all in one angle right in the centre of the opposite bottome: as in this forme: {diagram} which is so articiall, as well for strength as beauty; that no schadon, though the thin bottome of his cell should faile, can breake through into a cell of the other side. Hee that sees this, sees not a wonder? 
\10. *The Drone-combe./*/ Besides these ordinary combes, there is commonly one Drone-comb in a hive, wherein the Cephens are bred, made for the nonce with wider cells. \His.l.9.c.40./ *Sunt loculi ipsi fucorum ampliores, & singuntur seor sim quoque, per se favi fucorum./* Although in some hives part of the Drone-combes be made out with Nymph-cells. The Drone-combe being no thicker than others, and yet the Drones longer then the small Bees; they increase the length of his cells by covering them, not with a flat cover, as they doe the rest, but with a deepe hollow one like an old wives thrumbd cap: which afterward, when the Drones are bred, they take away. And when those cells are void of Cephens, they fill them as they doe the other with hony: yea and after swarming-time, if they want upper cells for their hony, they wil not tarry til their Cephens come forth themselves, but liking better their roome then their company, they draw them out of their seminaries before they be ripe. \*v.c./*4.*n./*31./ 
\11. *The Queenes cels are built single in divers places./*/ But the Queenes cells are built single, every one by himselfe: and that in divers places of the Hive, some above, and some beneath: that, as other princes, she may for her delight remove at hir pleasure. But, for the most part, in the out-sides 
[of]

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

of the combes: for although it be fit for Princes to be neere their chiefe Cities; yet doe they not love to be pestered in the midst of them. \12. *In fashion round./*/ In fashion they are round: which is the most perfect figure, as the six square is most fit for comely joining many such buildings together. They are also larger than the rest, to shew that subjects houses should not match their Soveraignes in greatnesse. In these Palaces do they breed their young Princes, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*18./ \Nat.hist.l.11.c.11./ *Pliny/* speaketh thus of them: *Regias imperatoribus extruunt amplas, magnificas, separatas, tuberculo eminentes./* \13. *The common error anent these celles./*/ The common people, finding them alwaies in those stalls that die, take them for certaine signes of death, and call them pipes, or taps: and therefore when they see them in a stal that they take, they say, This was taken in good time, for it is piped: and therefore would have stood no longer. But seeing none are without, no not the yongest swarms; ordinary reason might teach them to forgoe that fond conceipt. 
\14. *The combes doe often change their hue./*/ The Combes have successively sundry colours: white, yellow, browne, blacke. \Virgin wax and ordinary./ Their first colour white, by the end of the Summer is turned to a light yellow. Those that are taken and tried this first yeere, are called Virgin-wax, but the whiter the purer: and the rest are ordinarie. The second Summer this light yellow is changed to a sad. The third this sad yellow into a browne: which afterward, as they wax old and corrupt, altereth againe into a blackish and durtie colour: but these being tried will returne to yellow. 
\15. *Wax is gathered onely in foure months./*/ The time when Bees gather wax, is onely betweene *Taurus/* and *Virgo/* (unlesse *Aries/* be milde and warme:) for then they may begin in that month. 
\16. *Hony the second fruit is gathered in 9. moneths./*/ BUt Hony they gather all the yeere: save only in those 3 *still/* moneths, when the weather keepeth in both Bees and flowers, *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*59./ \17. *Two sorts of Hony./*/ And it is of two sorts: the one pure and liquid, which is called *Nectar/*, the other grosse and solid, which we may by like by reason tearme+ *Ambrosia./* For both serve for the food of these divine creatures.
+Yea rather this is the true *Nectar & Ambrosia/* wherwith *Jupiter/* was first nourished in the Ile of Crete, *v.c./*4.*n./*6. while the *Curetes/* hid him from Saturn. Which gave occassion to the Poets of this fiction, that the Bees were his

nurses. *Dicteo cæll regem pavêre sub antro./**Virg.Geor./*4. And afterward, when they would make him immortal; because of the long-preserving vertue that hony hath, (*v.c./*10.*par./*3.*n./*1.) they fained it to be his immortall food. *Jupiter Ambrosia satur est & nectare vivit./* *Mart.l./*11.*Ep./*58.
\18. *How Ambrosia or grosse hony is gathered./*/ The grosse hony is gathered by their fangs: from whence is it conveied by the fore-legs to the thighes of the hin-legs (*Quæ flores comportant prioribus pedibus fœmina onerant propter id natura scabra, pedes priores rostro:totæq onustæremeant farcina pandatæ/*) \Nat.hist.li.11.c.10./ and that so nimbly, that unlesse you have a quicke eie, you can scarce perceive it. 
This worke may best be seene in the spring, when they gather upon the blackthorne: for then by reason of the cold they are not so quicke.
\19. *Ambrosia, is the Schadons food, as water their drinke./*/ When they have brought these burdens home; they unload them into the dry cells for their young to feed on, which are not yet able to flie abroad. And in the beginning and ending of the yeere, looke what they save when the weather is faire, they lay up for themselves against a rainy day. Which, while it is good, they will feed on, to save their *Nectar/* as much as may bee. \20. *Being kept it is soone corrupted./*/ But this kinde of hony is like unto fresh fish: it must not long be kept. \21. *And then becommeth most unsavory stopping./*/ For if being laid up in the cells, by reason of plenty that comes in fresh and fresh, it lye unspent; after a while it corrupteth, and of sweet becommeth the sowrest and the most unsavory of all things both to taste and smell: which then they commonly call Stopping or Coome. \22. *Much stopping maketh the Bees forsake their hives./*/ Where there is any store of this stuffe, it doth so offend the Bees, that oft times it maketh them to forsake all. Most of them will that yeere goe forth in swarmes: and those few that are leaft will never prosper.
\23. *This Ambrosia is commonly taken for wax./*/ Anent this leg-stuffe or grosse hony there is a generall error. For, without all scruple or doubt, men doe count it and call it wax: (as did some also in time of old, whose opinion *Aristotle/* doth thus deliver. \His.l.9.40./ *Ceram apes perreptando flores capiunt priorum acumine pedum: mox priores in medios abstergunt, & medios in blæsa posteriorum./*) But against (as I shall shew you) both sense and reason. 
\24. *Which error is disproved by sense./*/ If you put it to your tongue, it hath the taste of hony: which wax hath not. If you feele it betweene your warme 
[cw: fingers,]

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

fingers, it muttereth apart, where wax sticketh fast together. If you put it to the fire, it melteth not, as wax doth. And whereas wax is all of one colour, *i./* white at the first, *v./* \*v.n./*14./ even as those little fallings of the new swarmes; (which is wax indeed) this leg-honie is of divers colours, white, black, yellow, greene, red, tawny, orenge, murry, and of sundry midling colours. Therefore sense doth say it is no wax. 
\25. *And reason./*/ The reasons are two. The first is because when they gather abundance of this stuffe, they have never the more wax. The other because when they make most wax, they gather none of this. 
For proofe of the first, All Bees betweene *Virgo/* and *Taurus/* do gather abundance of it: and yet are not their combes in this time any whit enlarged. Also one of those old stalls that are full of combes, doth carry more of this matter all the summer long than many swarmes: and yet have they no more wax at the end of the yeere then at the beginning.
For proofe of the other, The new swarmes within one weeke, if the weather serve them, will have halfe filled their hives with combes: and yet in all this space shall you scarce see one carry any of this. If you would know the reason why the stocks gather so much, and the new swarmes so little; it is because the stockes have *schadons/* which they feed with it, and the new swarmes have none. And if any foolish Bee do carry in *Ambrosia,/* it is put a dry cell where it turneth to Stopping, *v./* \*v.n./*21./ as I have seene within a fortnight after the hiving. 
\26. *And by authoritie./*/ And this, though now it seeme new, yet was it knowne many ages agoe. *Plinie/* writeth of it thus. \Nat.hist.l.11.c.7./ *Præter hæc/* (*præter ceram & nectar/*) *convehitur erithace, quam aliqui sandaracham, alij cerinthum vocant. Hic erit apum dum operantur cibus: qui sæpe invenitur in favorum inanitatibus sepositus; & ipse amari saporis./* Speaking in the last words of that which is corrupted *v/* \*V.n./*21./. And before him *Aristotle/* himselfe thus. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Mel apibus tum estate tum hyeme cibo est: sed recondunt alterum quoq cibarii genus, cui durities ceræ proxima quod sandaracham nonnulli appellant./*

\27.*How the pure Nectar is gathered./*/ The *Nectar/* or liquid hony the Bees gather with their tongues, whence they let it downe into their bottles, which are within them like unto bladders: each of them will hold a drop at once. You may see their little bellies strut withall. Men thinke, because they see nothing on their legs, that they come in leere: when they are better and more heavily laden then the other. These bottles, as soone as they come home, they empty into their combes. \Hist.an.li.5.c.22./ *Mel ore evomunt in cellas./* This *Nectar/* being cleere as Crystall at the first and liquid as water, when it is two or three yeeres old, becommeth white and hard. *Concrescit autem mel concoctum jam tempore: initio enim, ut aqua, dilutum est, & primis diebus sine crassitudine cernitur./* \Hist.an.l.5.c.22/
\28. *Two sorts of Nectar./*/ \*Live-hony and stone-hony./*/
While it coninueth liquid, and will runne of it selfe, it is called live-hony: when it is turned white and hard (even like unto sugar) it is called corn-hony, or stone-hony.  
\29. *Live-hony of two sorts./*/ And the live-hony is of two sorts: that which is gathered by a swarme, cleere and crystalline at the first, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*2.*n./*13./ layd up in virgin-wax, *v./* \*V.n./*14./ and taken the same yeere, is the right virgin honie: the other, which is yellow and thicker, gathered by an old stall, and therefore kept in corrupter cells with drosse and courser hony, is called ordinary. 
\30. *The finest ordinary is a kinde of Virgin-hony./*/
The first shoot whereof (specially in a plentifull yeere of *Nectar/*-dewes) running sheere of it selfe, is a kinde of virgin-hony, *v./* and little inferiour to the right. 
*Nectar,/* whether it be ordinary or virgin-hony, is either finer or courser, according as the soile is where it is gathered: *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*2.*n./*6./ For the best countries, which yeeld the best wheat and the best wooll, yeeld also the best hony. And therefore the wood-lands of Hampshire have better honie than the heath, and the champion or field country, better than the woodlands. The reason is, because where the flowers are most fragrant and vertuous, as well of the fields as gardens, in the purest and sweetest aire; there are the honi-dewes, which are extracted from them, are most fine and pure, *v.n./*40.
\32. *The full cels they close with wax./*/ When the cells are full, they close them up with little filmes of wax, which they wil not breake untill winter and hunger drive them to it. And thus doe they all the summer,
[cw: descending]

===

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

descending lower and lower from one cell to another, untill *Virgo/*: after which time they lay up no more in store. For honie then waxeth scarce abroad: and thence-forth they can gather no more wax to shut it in. As for that which they purchase by sight and forraging, it doth them little good. For the most part of it they presentlie spend: and if they save any, they halfe fill a few cels with it: which being uncovered, either themselves or some other theeves quicklie devoure: according to the Proverbe, *Evill gotten goods are soone spent/*.
\33. *Nectar & Ambrosia made of many simples, whereof each moneth yeeldeth variety./*/ This *Nectar/* and *Ambrosia/*, together with those sweet and holesome vessells that doe containe them, are gathered from infinite varietie of herbs, flowers, and trees, which God in his provident bounty hath ordained to succeed one another. So that from *Pisces/* to *Sagitt./* there never want some plants or other, containing these sweets: which the Bees featly draw from them, without any hurt to the fruits: *Fructibus nullis nocetur/* \Nat.hist.lib II.c.8./
\34. *Dandelion continueth longest./*/ The Dent-delion, or after the French pronounciation Dandelion, may well be called *apiastrum/* or *mellissophyllon/*. For the Bees gather upon it almost all the yeere. The Dazy and Yelowcrea are next for continuance, but nothing so much regarded. 
\35. *What Pisces yeeldeth./*/ The Winter Giliflowre and the Hazell are the first. For they spring in *Pisces,/* and sometime before. After them the Dazy and the hearbe Bearefoot, the Violet, &c. 
\36. *What Aries./*/ In *Aries/* besides those before named, the Box, the Withy-palme, both greene yeelding *Nectar/*, and yelow yeelding *Ambrosia,/* Daffadill, Lide-lilie, blackthorne, &c. 
\37. *Taurus./*/ In *Taurus/* Slow-tree, Plum-tree, Goosebery not blowne, and blowne, Cherry, Peare, Cockbell, which is a Wood-flowre. About the middle of this month the chiefest plants begin to flourish in great abundance: as Apple, Crab, Barbery, Beech, Crowpickes, Charlocke, Rosemary, &c. But specially the plentifull Vetch and Maple. They gather on the flowre of the Maple a whole month together, and somewhat on the flowre of the Vetch when his time is *v./* \*V.n./* 39./ but the greatest store of hony is drawne out of the black Spot of the

little picked leafe of the Vetch, which groweth on each side the two or three upper-most joynts. These they ply continually: I never saw Vetches, how farre soever from Hives, that for three moneths together (if the weather served) were not full of Bees.
\38. *Gemini./*/ In *Gemini/*, the first moneth of fruitfull Summer, besides those prime Plants, Vetch and Maple (which now are in their prime) and the rest forenamed; Beanes also, which with their flowers have also blacke spotted leaves like Vetches, on which sometime they gather, Arch-angell, Barberie, Fumitorie, Ribwort a kinde of Plantanie, Holme or Hollie, Hawthorne, Elder, red Honie-suckle, Red-weede, white Honie-suckle, which they like much better than the red. &c. 
\39. *Cancer./* In *Cancer/* with the fore-named, the blossome of the Vetch, as well as the Leafe, Benet, Malowes, the soveraigne Tyme, which yeeldeth only *Nectar:/* and therefore he was deceived that said *Crura Thymo plena/*. Tyme, for the time it lasteth, yeeldeth most and best Honie: and therefore in old time was accounted chiefe \Pl.nat.hist.l.11.c.21./ \Hist.l.9.c.40./ Vir.Georg.4/ *(Thymus aptissimus ad mellificium. Pastus gratissimus apibus Thymum est. 
Dum Thymo pascentur apes, dum rore cicadæ./*) 
*Himettus/* in *Greece/*, and *Hybla/* in *Sicily/* were so famous for Bees and Honie, because there grew such store of Tyme: \Var.l.3.c.16./ *Propter hoc Siculum mel fert palmam, quod ibi Thymum bonum & frequens est./* The Knap-weed flourisheth about the middle of this moneth, and the Blackberie about a weeke after: Both which, as sweet and plentifull, the Bees much haunt.
\40. *Of Honie-dewes./*/ But the greatest plentie of the purest *Nectar/* commeth from above: which Almightie God doth miraculously destill out of the Aire \Virg.Georg./ (*aerei mellis cœlestia dona/*) and hath appointed the *Oake/* among all the trees of the Wood, to receive and keepe the same upon his smooth and solide leaves, (*Et quercus sudabunt roscida mella/*) \Virg.Pollio./ untill either the Bees tongue, or the heat of the Sunne have drawne it away. \41. *The Bees worke most earnestly in a Honie-dew./*/ When there is a Honie-dew, you may perceive by the Bees: for, as if they smelled it *v:/* \*V.c.1.n.44./*/ by the sweetnesse of the Aire, they presently issue out of their Hives, in great haste following one an

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

other: and refusing their old haunts, search and seeke after the *Oake:/* which for that time shall have more of their custome, than all the Plants of the Earth. Sometime the Maple and Hazell, take part with the *Oake:/* but little and seldome. While the Honie-dew lasteth, they are exceeding earnest, plying their businesse like men in Harvest: you may see them so thicke at the Hive-doore passing to and fro, that oftentimes they throw downe one an other for haste. 
\42. *What the Honie-dew is./*/ What this *Mel Roscidum/* should be, \Nat.hist.li.11.c.12/ *Plinie/* seemeth much to doubt where he saith *Sive illud sit cœli sudor sive quædam syderum saliva, sive purgantis se aeris succus./* But, if conjectures might be admitted, I would rather judge it to be the verie quintessence of all the sweetnesse of the earth (which at that time is most plentifull) drawne up, as other dewes, in vapours into the third Region of the Aire, by the exceeding and continuall heat of the Sunne; and there concrete and condensated by the nightly cold into this most sweete and Soveraigne *Nectar:/* and then doth it descend unto the earth in a dew or small drizling raine: that he might well say, *Constat materiam, ex qua mel gignitur, rori esse congenerem./* \Galen.de aliment. li.3/ Which opinion is the more probable for these reasons. First because that when the yeare is backward in his fruits, the Honie-dewes are also backward: comming onely at such time as the flowers have the most solid and best juyce. Before, when the juyce is weake and waterish, and afterward, when it is dryed and wasted, they are not. *v:/* \*V.+in/*43./ Secondly, because that in more hot & Southernly climats, where the fruits are more forward, the Hony-dewes also are more timely: as in *Italy/* before \Nat.hist.lib.11.c.12/ *Gemini. Non omnino/*, saith *Plinie, prius vergiliarum exortu: v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n/*20/ whereas with us they fall not usually before *Cancer/*. And thirdly, because the Countries that have store of the best and sweetest flowers, have ever the best Honie.*v.n./*29.
\43. *When the Honie-dewes are most frequent./*/ The hotter and drier the Summer is, the greater and more frequent are the Honie-dewes: cold and wet weather is unkinde for them: much raine at any time, as comming from a higher Region, washeth away that which is alreadie elevated: (so that there can be no more untill an other fit of hot

and dry weather) and in the end it dissolveth them quite.
\44. *The time when they fall./*/ The time in which these Honie-dewes fall, is usually betweene the first and last daies of this moneth: although the continuance of hot and dry weather may cause them come somewhat rather, or last somewhat longer, even untill mid-*Leo/* or+ after. They may happen at any time of the day: but for the most part in the morning before it be light: *Sub lucanis temporibus. Itaque tum prima aurora folia arborum melle roscida inveniuntur./* \Nat.Hist.li.11.c.12./ And then shall you have the Bees up in a morning as soone as they can see, making such a shrill noise where they goe, that as merrie Gossips when they meet, a man may heare them farther than see them. 
+In the yeare 1613, almost two moneths after the usuall time, namely in the later part of *Virgo,/* there fell divers Honie-dewes: which came to passe by reason that continuall wet kept them backe in their due time, and *Virgo/* followed exceeding hot, fit weather for them. But because the state of the flowers was then weake, the state of those Honie-dewes also was so weake, that the Bees were little the better for them. The stalls, that were taken, proved light: and most of the swarmes and stocks, that were kept for store, died for want before the end of Winter. Except onely in the Heath Countries, where the Heath-flower being then in his prime, those late Honie-dewes made fat stalls.
\45 *What Leo yeeldeth./*/ In *Leo/* Vetches, Malowes, Tyme, Knap-weede, Blacke-berie, white Honie-suckle, Redweed, Thistle, Melone, &c. 
Now also doe they gather on the Lavender, if their hastie Dames doe not gather it from them before it be readie.
\46. *Virgo./*/ In *Virgo/* Knap-weed, Black-berie, Redweed, Dandelion, Malowes, Borage, &c. and the ample Heath, which yeeldeth Honie like unto their Wooll. *V.n./*31.and *c./*10.*p./*2.*n./*12. 
\47. *Libra./*/ In *Libra/* Dandelion, Heath, Ivie, &c.
\48. *Scorpio./*/ In *Scorpio/* Dandelion, Ivie, Arch-angell, &c.
\49. *The Bees gather but of one kinde of of flower in one voyage./*/ And in this great varietie this is strange, that where they beginne they will make an end: and not meddle with any flowre of other sort, untill they have their load. *Mos apibus ne florum plura genera petant uno eodemq profectu, sed singulis singula./* Insomuch as those which beginne with the flower of the Vetch will not once touch \Hist.ac.l.9.c.40/ the rich spotted leafe of the same, before they have beene at home. Although when they come to a flower that yeeldeth both *Nectar/* and 
[cw: *Ambrosia,/*]

===

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

*Ambrosia,/*, they wil use sometime the Tongue, and sometime the Fangs, and gather them both. 
\50. *They gather Honie out of poison./*/ But this may seeme more strange and wonderfull, that out of the most stinking and poisonfull weeds, as Redweed, +Margs,\+Mathers or May-weed, *Cotula fœtida/*/ Henbane, and the like, they gather most sweet and holesome Honie: and yet regard not the best and sweetest Hearbs and Flowers, as the Rose, the Prim-rose, Clove-Giliflowers; Wheat, Barley, Pease, &c.
\51. *What store of Honie a stall may have./*/ What store of Wax and Honie a stall may gather, is uncertaine: some having more, some lesse, according to the number of the Bees, the greatnesse of the Hive, and the plentifulnesse of the yeares. With us it is counted a good stall that yeeldeth two or three gawnes of Pulse: although in a tree there have beene found more than seven or eight. But in other Northerne Countries we reade of farre greater quantities. \Nat.hist.li.11.c.24/ *Plinie/* affirmeth, that there was seene in *Germany/* a Honie-comb eight foot long. And *Paulus Jovius,/* that in *Moscovia/* there are found in the Woods and Wildernesses great Lakes of Honie, which the Bees have forsaken, in the hollow trunkes of marvellous huge trees. \De legatione Moscovitarum, & Munsterus de Moscovia./ In so much that Honie and Wax are the most certaine commodities of that Countrey. Where, by that occasion, he setteth down this Storie, reported by *Demetrius/* a *Moscovite/* Ambassadour sent to Rome. A neighbour of mine (saith he) searching in the woods for Honie, slipt downe into a great hollow tree, and there sunke into a Lake of Honie up to the breast: where when he had stucke fast two daies, calling and crying out in vaine for helpe, because no bodie in the meane while came nigh that solitarie place; at length when he was out of all hope of life, he was strangely delivered by the meanes of a great Beare: which comming thither about the same businesse that he did, and smelling the Honie stirred with his striving, clambered up to the top of the tree, and thence began to let himselfe downe backward into it. The man bethinking himselfe, and knowing the worst was but death, which in that place he was sure of, beclipt the Beare fast with both his hands about the loines, and whithall made an out-cry as lowd as he could. The Beare being thus sud-

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

dainely affrighted, what with the handling, and what with the noise, made up again with all speed possible: the man held, and the Beare pulled, untill with maine force he had drawne *Dun out of the mire/*: and then, being let goe, away he trots *more afeard then hurt,/* leaving the smeared swaine in a joyful feare. 
\52. *Bees have necessarie use of water./*/ THE Bees earnest and hot Labour, and the drought of the Aire, together with their cholerike Complexion, which their very colour bewrayeth, doth cause them much to desire cold Water. \53. *Chiefly for their breed/*/ Some thinke it serveth onely to feede their Schadons: (*Aquam tum portant, cum prolem nutriunt) v:/* \Hist.an.l.9.c.40./ and that not without reason, seeing that *Ambrosia/* their daily food is hot and dry: and indeed when the Drones are done away, and breeding is ended, the Bees are nothing so frequent at the watring-places. But *Columella/* thinketh the use thereof to be more generall, \De re rust. l.9.c.5./ *Sine qua neque, favi, neque, mella, nec pulli deniq figurari queunt./* Unto whom the Poet, in the place first cited in this Chapter, seemeth to assent; making water and flowers the common matter of their three workes.
\54. *The making of the Watering place./*/ The Watring-place should+ not be farre from your Garden,+ in the next side of a Pond or Brooke made shelving, not very steepe, in manner of a Foord, and defended from Beasts, Geese, Duckes, and such like: and especially young Ducklings.*v./*¶ 3.*in.n./*59.
\Virg.Geor./
\55. *How to finde wilde Bees./*/ +For they will never goe farre for water, if any be to be had neere hand. *Sub mænibus urbis aquantur./* And therefore when you see Bees watring in woods or other places, not neere any Hives; bee sure those are wilde Bees, which are not farre from their neast. Watch them therefore which way they flie: for they will thence directly to it. Which if it be not within view, take a Reede or Kex, or some like hollow thing open at one end, with a chinke cut in the other to let in light: and taking up a Bee by the wings put her into the Cane, and shut her in with your thumb: while she goeth downe to the light, put in an other, and so many as you thinke good. And then where you last see the Bees flying homeward from the water, goe to that place, and there let out one of the Bees in the box: which, when she hath cast a Ring to know where she is, will fly as directly home as the other: likewise where you see her last, let out another: and so the rest, untill they have brought you to the stall.

+Lest the Bees, flying over the water unto it, be throwne downe by tempestuous winds, and so drowned: for which cause it is good to lay lugs overthwart the water, and other staies; that recovering them they may dry themselves againe, and so escape. 
\Virg. Geor./ *In medium seu stabis iners, seu profluet humor,
Transversas salices & grandia conijce saxa.
Pontibus ut crebris possint consistere, & alas
Pandere ad æstiniuum solem, si forte morantes
Sparserit, aut præcerps Neptuno immerserit Eurus./*
+That they may safely settle upon it, and that it may alwaies be kept moist by the neerenesse of the water. For they choose rather to draw their drinke out of moist earth, than from the water it selfe, though it never be so clear: peradventure that the earth having received his earthinesse, which before was insensibly mixt with the water, their triple searching tongue might the better trie out the pure element of water. 
+Which otherwise will be the death of many for they are so earnest in their businesse, that though you offer to tread upon them, they will not move. 
\56. *Bee-troughes in Gardens profitable./*/ But because in the cold windie weather of the Spring, (at which time of the yeare the Bees have most use of water, *v./*) \*V.n.53./*/ these watering places of Ponds and Brookes are dangerous; (where you may then see many throwne downe and drowned, and others, that scape drowning, to be so chilled, when they have filled themselves with cold water; that they are not able to endure the wind, but faile and fall by the way) therefore it is behoveful to have Troughes in your gardens, made for the nonce: whence the Bees may both sooner and safer fetch their water.  
\57. *The forme and size of a Bee-trough./*/ For the forme and size of a Trough, let his hollownesse be two foot in length, seven or eight inches in breadth, and foure in depth; the bottome foure inches thicke; the ends six or seven; and the sides halfe so much. Moreover, let the hollownesse be divided into foure equall parts, by one partition of inch-board, in the middle from side to side; and by two partitions of halfe-inch-board, from each end unto the middle partition: after this fashion.

\58. *The trough-cover, and the use of it./*/ And to keepe the Bees from danger of drowning, unto which they are very obnoxious, for it they but touch the water with their wings, they cannot rise from it) let each Quarter of the Trough have his Cover, in thicknesse about halfe an inch, in bredth and length fitting to his Quarter; but so, that without let it may rise and fall without the water. 
The matter of this Cover must be corke, which must as well have open spaces for the water to take aire; as places for the Bees to light on: lest it being covered too close, doe corrupt and become unsavourie. It is best to divide each cover into two equall parts: and in the edges on both sides to cut little nickes. And so this may be the forme of it. 

{diagram}

Other fashions both of their Troughes, and of their Covers, may be devised: but these have seemed to me in all respects most fitting. 
\59. *The seasoning and ordering of the Bee-trough./*/ A new Trough thus framed and fitted, is to be seasoned before it be used, by often scalding it, and changing the foule water; untill, having stood a day or two, it remaineth cleare, and without a glittering slime: afterward the older and more earthie it is, the better they like it. 
The Trough being seasoned, set in some convenient place, about a pearch from the Bees; having a moveable plancke,

or the like, to defend it from cold rough winds in the spring, and from the Sunne when it is hot. At which time keepe the Trough full, lest the water be soone over-heated: and in cold weather let the water be shallow, that the Bees may drinke safely below, out of the chilling wind. 
¶ 1. Bespread the ends of the Trough with cow-cloome, to keep them from chapping. 
¶ 2. In frostie nights cover all the Trough, to keepe the water from freezing. 
¶ 3. Keepe all Poultrie, and specially Ducklings, and Hens with chicken, out of your Garden: for, drinking at the Troughes, they will trouble, and tread upon the Bees. And the brood-hens will kill them, for feare of stinging their chicken: and so will Ducklings also at the first, taking them for flies; which when they have tasted, they will afterwards let alone. 
\60. *Bee-troughes of stone./*/ You may also make good Troughes of Free-stone, with woodden partitions let into the stone: but they are more apt to chill the Bees in cold weather, until they be mossie.
\61. *Sometime they water in the streets./*/ Sometime they will lie sucking at the neere plashes, puddles, and mire in the streets: where many are trod under foot of men and beasts. See therefore that such places be kept cleane and drie. 
\62. *And after a showre, all about the garden./*/ After a showre they water for the most part in your Garden upon the bare earth, the grasse, and wheresoever they finde it wet from above. In the chiefe breeding months *Aries,/* *Taurus,/* and *Gemini/*, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*13./ when the colde raine or winde hath kept them in some part of the day, they wil lie so thick upon the ground, if you have any store; that you can scarce tread beside them. At such time therefore let no heedlesse stranger come among them.
