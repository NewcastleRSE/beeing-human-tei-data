#THE PREFACE/#  

##*to the Reader./*/##  

{T}He great Naturalist, to expresse the excellency of the nature of Bees, saith thus, *Inter omnia insecta principatus apibus et jure præcipua admiratio; solis ex eo genere hominum causam genitis/*. \*Plin. Nat. hist. l. II, ca. 5/*/ Of all *insecta/* the Bees are chiefe, and worthily to bee most admired; beeing the only things of that kinde, which are bred for the behoofe of men. The later part of which saying, although the delicate Silk-worme have in some hoter Climates disproved; (for in the colder countries, such as is our Iland of *Britaine/*, I doubt mee shee will never quit cost: and therefore is here to be entertained only of them, that doe more respect their pleasure, than their profit; and doe content themselves with the beholding of their queint worke, not expecting any further recompence for their expence and paines;) yet must shee needs confesse the former, and, wheresoever she meet the ingenuous and laborious Bee, yeeld the precendence to her, as to hir Better. For the fruite of the Silk-worme serveth onlie to cover the body; but the fruit of the Bees to nourish and cure it: that is to be applied outwardly, this to be inwardly received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health and necessity. But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bee is so great and wonderfull, so comely for order and [cw: beauty,]

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$

beauty, so excellent for Art and wisdome, and so full of pleasure and profit; that the contemplation thereof may well beseeme an ingenious nature. And therefore not without cause are the Bees called the Muses birds: *Apes cum causa Musarum esse dicuntur volucres./* \*Var.l.3.c.15./*/
The love of which did so ravish *Aristomachus/* and *Philiscus/*, that, as *Plinie/* reporteth,\*Nat hist.l./*II.c.9./ they were pleased to spend most of their time in this pleasing businesse. *Ne quis/* (saith hee) *miretur amore earum captos Aristomachum Solensem duodesexaginta annis nihil aliud egisse; Philiscum vero Thasium in desertis apes colentem Agrium cognomimatum: qui ambo scripsere de iis/*. *Aristotle/* thought his *Historia animalium/* unperfect, unlesse he had inserted a Tract of the Nature of Bees: of which hee discourseth more at large, then he doth of any other living creature. *Plinie/* likewise in his *Naturalis historia/* is very copious in this argument. Besides whom, divers other haue written thereof: as *Columella, Varro, Palladius, Averroes/*. Yea the learned and grave Fathers of the Church *S. Ambrose/*, and *Isidore/* have thought it a subject fit for their penns. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later times both in Latine and English.
But the many yeeres experiments & observations, which those great Bee-masters *Aristom./* and *Philiscus/* had leaft in writing to posterity; Time, ah injurious Time, hath buried into oblivion. And for the rest that are extant, they seeme unto me to rely more upon the relation of others, than any certaine knowledge of their owne. Notwithstanding them are scattered in them, specially in *Aristotle/* & *Plinie/*, among many false and frivolous conceits, some true and profitable notes: which being found agreeable to experience, I have here and there in this Treatise, as the matter inspireth, for ornament and authoritie inserted. But the later Writers, imitating the ancient where they thought good, chusing some of their directions and refusing o-

thers doe, for the most part, unluckily light upon the worse: so that being compared, they are no way matchable unto them; whom by the advantage of time they might haue surpassed. Among which *Georgius Pictorius/* a learned Physician deserveth best, as having taken most paines in perusing the ancient Authors, and gathering their matter into his method. Whom one *T. H./* of *London/* translating word for word into English, as well as he could, concealing the Authors name, adventured to publish in his owne name. These and the like when a scholar hath thoroughly read, he thinketh himselfe throughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth abroad to put his skil in name. These and the like when a Scholar hath thoroughly read, hee thinketh himselfe thoroughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth abroad to put his reading in practise, every silly woman is ready to deride his learned ignorance. 
Wherefore considering howe greate the vertue and efficacy of the fruite of Bees is, \v.c.10.p.3/ both for the preserving, and restoring of mans health, I thought it not amisse to spend some by-time for my recreation, in searching out their nature and properties, their helpes and hinderances, that I might know how to doe good unto them, which are so good for us, and what is the due and righte ordering of these delightful, profitable, and necessary creatures. And having to my contentment, though to my cost, in some sort obtained my desire, I was incited, even by the rule of charitie, to communicate that to my neighbours and country-men, which I have found so beneficiall to my selfe: so that the Reader may now freely reape the fruit of that, which the Author hath deerely sowen vnto him.
\*De generat.an.l.3.c.10/*/ The Philosopher intreating of the breeding of Bees, professeth himselfe uncertaine of their sex: and therefore, willing in this uncertainty to grace so worthy a creature with the worthier title, he every where calleth their governor *βασιλεύς/*, *Rex/*. As many as followed him, searching no farther then he did, were contente to say as he said. So that I am in- [cw: forced]

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$

forced (unlesse I wil choose rather to offend in *rebus/* then in *vocibus/*) by their leave and thine (learned Reader) to straine the ordinarie signification of the word *Rex/*, and, in such places, to translate it *Queene/*, sith the males heere beare no sway at al, this being an *Amazonian or Feminine kingdome. v./* \*V.c.4.n.11/*/
In distinguishing the times of the yeere, I use the Astronomicall months, as most natural and fitting to my purpose *v/*. \V.c.3.n.36./ Where note that by the name of each moneth, is commonly understood the first day of the same moneth (namely, wheresovever this preposition *At/* is set before it) except only where it followeth, *In/*, or *After/*, or otherwise the sense doth plainely shew that it is spoken of the whole Moneth. 
When you have once, for your satisfaction, perused this Booke, you need not afterward seeke farre for anything therein, whereof you doubt: the *Index/* of the Chapters or Contents of the Booke; and of the Marginall notes, or Contents of the Chapters will readily direct you. For example, if you would know the Spleeting of Hives, or the manner of Hiving Bees; looking into the Index of the Chapter, you shall perceive the one to appertaine to the Third, and the other to the Fifth; and running over the Contents of either Chapter, you shall find the first to be the Tenth note, and the other the 53. Then turning to these Marginall Notes in the said Chapters, you have in the Text over against them your desire.
Note also, that whereas you have in the Margin, with these Marginall Notes, certaine References unto other places of the Booke, for further explanation of those places against which they stand; *V./* signifieth *vide/*, or *See, C./* with his number the Chapter, and *N./* with his number the Marginall Note. But if *N./* follow *V./* without *C/*; then doth it note some Note of the same Chapter. [cw: I am]

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$
 
I am out of doubt that this Booke of *Bees/* will in his Infancy lie hidden in obscuritie, as the Booke of *Tropes/* and *Figures/* did for a while goe unregarded, without friends or acquaintance: But as that did by litle & litle insinuat it selfe into the love and liking of many Schooles, yea of the Vniversitie it selfe, where it hath been both privately and publikely read; (a favour, which this Mother doth seldome afford to hir owne Children, lest haply she should seeme too fond over them) so this will in time travell into the most remote parts of this great kingdome of Great *Britaine/*, and be entertained of all sorts both learned and unlearned: although the *Muses/* Birds are fittest for the *Muses/*, and the knowledge of their long-hidden secrets was cheifly published for the *Muses friends/*. *Quibus me, quicquid sum, & studia mea dico.

When I had view'd this Common-wealth of *Bees,/*
Observ'd their *Lives/*, their *Art/*, and their Degrees
As; how, beside their painefull *Vulgar ones/*, 
They have their *Prince/*, their *Captaines/*, and their *Drones/*;
How they *Agree/*; how temp'ratly they *Feed/*; 
How curiously they *Build/*; how chastly *Breed/*;
How seriously their *Bus'nesse/* they intend; 
How stoutly they their *Common-good/* defend;

[cw: How]

How timely their *Provisions/* are provided; 
How orderly their *Labours/* are divided; 
What *Vertues/* patterns, and what grounds of *Art/*,
What *Pleasures/*, and what *Profits/* they impart: 
When these, with all those other things I minde
Which in this *Booke/*, concerning *Bees/*, I finde:
Me thinkes, there is not halfe that worth in *Mee/*, 
Which I have apprehened in a *Bee/*, 
And that the *Pismere/*, and these *Hony-flies/*, 
Instruct us better to Philosophize, 
Than all those tedious *Volumes/*, which, as yet, 
Are leaft unto us by meere *Humane-wit/*. 
For, whereas those but only *Rules/* doe give; 
These by *Examples/* teach us how to live.
Great *God Almighty!/* in thy pretty *Bee/*, 
Mine Eie (as written in small letters) sees
An *Abstract/* of that Wisdome, Power, and Love,
Which is imprinted on the *Heav'ns/* abive
In larger *Volumes/*, for their eies to see,
That in such *little prints/* behold not Thee. 
And in this Workmanship (oh Lord) of thine, 
I pray thy *Wisdome/*, and thy *Power/* divine.
And *Praise/* deserves this *Author/*; who hath chose
So well his Times of Leisure to dispose; 
And in that *Recreation/* to delight,
Which honour *God/*, and *us/* advantage might. 
For, since our humane weaknesse doth require,
That in our serioust *Labours/* we retire; 
(Because unlesse the String be sometime slacke
The strongest Bow will have the feeblest backe)
What *Recreation/* better can befit
Our grave *Divines/*; than (when the *Holy writ/*
Is laid aside) in *Gods/* great booke of *Creatures/*
To reade his *Wisdome/*, and their usefull *Natures?/*
Thus doth our *Author/*. And, not only thus; 
But, like his *Bees/* makes hony too for us. 
And is contended that, to helpe us thrive, 
We should partake the profit of his *Hive./*

For which (*my share/*) I thanke him: and for those

#THE FEMININE MONARCHIE,/# ##OR The Historie of BEES./##

##CHAP. I. *Of the Nature and properties of Bees, and of their Queene./*
CHAP. I./##

{A}Mong all the creatures which our bountifull God hath made for the use and service of man, in respect for the use and service of man, in respect of great profit with small cost, of their ubiquitie or being in all Countries, and of their continuall labour and comly order, the Bees are most to be admired. \1. *Bees yeelde great profit with smal cost/*/ For first with the provision of a Hive and some little care and attendance, which need be no hindrance to other businesse, but rather a delightfull recreation amid the same; they bring in store of sweet delicates most holesome both for meate and medicine, *Fructus apum ab omnibus desideratur, & quæritur: nec pro personarum diversitate discernitur, sed indiscreta sui gratia regibus pariter ac mediocribus æquali suavitate dulcescit: nec solum voluptati, sed etiam saluti est./* \Ambrosius Hexamer. l. 5.cap.21./ And another saith, *Mille ad usus vitæ laborem tolerant & opera conficiunt/* \Pli nat.hist l.ii.c.5/: as they well know, who know the rare vertues of Honie and Waxe: a taste whereof I wil give you in the last chapter. [cw: Secondly,]

===

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees/*/$

\*2 Every Country for for Bees./*/ Secondly whereas *non omnis fert omnia tellus,/* some Country yeeldeth one fruit, some an other; some beareth one graine, some an other; some breedeth one kind of Cattle, some an other: there is no ground of what nature soever it be, whether it be hot or cold, wet or drie, hill or dale, woodland or champian, meddow, pasture, or arable: in a word whether it be battle or barren) which yeeldeth not matter for the Bee to work upon. 
\*3 Bees abhorre idlenesse./*/ And thirdly, in their labour and order at home and abroad they are so admirable, that they may be a patterne unto men, both of the one and of the other. For unlesse they be let by weather, weaknesse, or want of matter to worke on, their labour never ceaseth. \Plin. nat. hist.l.ii.c.5/ In admiration whereof, one saith,  *Quos efficaciæ industriæque tantæ comparemus nervos? Quas vires? Quos ratione medius fidius viros?/* 
\*4 Bees have a Common-wealth/*/ And for their order, it is such that they may well bee said to have a Common-wealth, since all that they doe is in common without any private respect. \Nat hist II.c.5/ *Nihil norunt nisi commune:/* They worke for all, they watch for all, they fight for all. \5 *Their working, watching, fighting, dwelling, dyet, wealth, and young ones are all in common./*/ In their private quarrels, when they are from the Hive or common treasury, howsoever you use them, they will not resist, if by any meanes they can get away. *Cum ruri sint, nec sibi invicem, nec ullis aliis nocent; at vero apud suos alveos pugnant acerrimè/*: their dwelling and diet are common to al alike: they have like common care both of their wealth and young ones. \Arist.hist.anim.lib.9.cap.40./ 
\Ambr.Hex.lib.5.ca.21.& Basil.Hexam.Homil.8./ *Solæ in omni genere animantium communem omnibus sobolem habent, unam omnes incolunt mansionem, unius patriæ clauduntur limine, in commune omnibus labor, communis cibus, communis operatio, communis usus, & fructus est./* \6 Bees alwaies loial to their soveraigne./ And al this under the government of one Monarch, of whom above all things they have a principall care and respect, loving, reverencing, and obeying her *v:/* in all things. 
\*V. Præfat./* Virg. Georg. *V.c.7.n.27.& 42./*/ 
*Præterea regem non sic Ægyptus & ingens
Lydia, nec populi Parthorum aut Medus Hydaspes 
Observant: rege incolumi mens omnibus una est:
Amisso rupere fidem; contructaque una est:
Diripuere ipsæ, & crates solvere favorum
Ille operum custos, illum admirantur: & omnes

Circumstant fremitu denso, stipantque, frequentes,
Et sæpe attollunt humeris, & corpora bello
Objectant, pulchramque, petunt per vulnera mortem./*
If she goe forth to solace her selfe, (as sometime she will) many of them attend upon her, guarding hir person before and behinde; they which come forth before her, ever now and then returning, and looking backe, and making withall an extraordinarie noise, as if they spake the language of the Knight Marshals men, and so away they flye together, and anone in like manner they attend her back againe. This I may say, because I have seene it: although the Philosopher be of another minde: *Reges/*, saith hee, *nunquam foris visuntur, nisi cum migratur./* \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40./ If by hir voice she bid them goe, they swarme; if being abroad she dislike the weather, or lighting-place, they quickly returne home againe: while she cheereth them to battaile they fight, *v:/*, \Vid.c.7.n.35./ while she is well, they are cheerefull about their worke; if she droope and dye, they will never after enjoy their home, but either languish there till they bee dead too, or yeelding the Robbers, *v:/* fly away with them *v:/* *Rege mortuo moret plebs ignava, non cibos convehit, non procedit, tristi tantum murmure glomeratur circa corpus eius./* \*V.c.7.n.27./*/ \*V.c.7.n.42/*/ 
\Nat.hist.li.II.c.17/ 
\7 *Bees endure no government, but a Monarchie./*/But if they have many Princes, as when two flye away with one swarme, or when two swarmes are hived together; they will not be quiet till one of them be cassiered: which somtime they bring downe that evening to the mantle, *v./* where you may finde her covered with a little heape of Bees: otherwise the next day they carie forth either dead or deadly wounded. Concerning which matter, I will here relate one memorable experiment. Two swarmes being put together, the Bees on both sides, as their manner is, made a murmuring noise, as being discontented with the suddain congresse of Strangers: but knowing wel that the more the merrier, the safer, the warmer, yea, and the better provided; they were quickly made friends. And having agreed which Queene should reigne, and which should die, three or foure Bees brought one of them downe betweene them, pulling and haling her as if they were leading her to execution: which I by chance perceiving, got hold of her by the wings, and with much adoe 
[cw: tooke]

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees/*/$

tooke her from them. After a while (to see what would come of it) I put her into the Hive againe: no sooner was she among them, but the tumult began afresh, greater then before, and presently they fell together by the eares, fiercely fighting and killing one another, for the space of more than an houre together: and by no meanes would cease, untill the poore condemned Queene was brought forth slaine and laid before the doore. Which done, the strife presently ended, and the Bees agreed well together. 

Somtime when one swarme is put to another, though they do not fight, yet will they not agree of their choice in two or three daies, keeping their Queenes close on both sides. BUt then all this while they never be at quiet day or night, nor once offer to work, untill one of them being deposed, they be united in the other. *Vide plura super hac re c.5.n.74.75.76./*
Likewise if the old Queene bring forth many Princes (as she may have six or seven, yea sometime halfe a score or more, which superfluitie nature affoordeth for more suretie, in case some miscarrie) then, lest the multitude of Rulers should distract the unstable Commons into factions, within two daies after the last swarme, yea sometime (when unkinde weather keepeth him in over long) even before he come forth, you shall finde the superfluous Princes dead before the Hive: I have taken eight of them up together brought out of one hive, when two were alreadie gone forth with their swarmes. For the Bees abhorre as well Polyarchie, as Anarchie, God having shewed in them unto men, an expresse patterne of A PERFECT MONARCHIE, THE MOST NATURAL AND ABSOLUTE FORME OF GOVERNMENT. [Greek script] \Hom.II.a.9./ 
\9 The description of the queene-Bee/ The Queene is a faire and stately Bee, differing from the vulgar both in shape and colour: hir backe is all over of a brighter browne: hir belly even from the top of hir fangs, to the tip of hir traine, is of a sad yellow, somewhat deeper then the richest gold. Shee is longer then a hony-Bee, by one third part, that is, almost an inch long: she is also bigger then a hony-Bee, but not so bigge as a Drone, although somewhat longer: hir head proportionable, but 
[cw: that]

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

that is more round then the little Bees, by reason hir fanges be shorter: hir tonge not halfe so long as theirs: for whereas they gather with the one Nectar, with the other Ambrosia; *v./* shee hath no need to use either, being to be maintained, as other Princes, by the labour of hir subjects; hir wings of the same size with a small Bee, and therefore in respect of hir long body, they seeme very short, resembling rather a cloake than a gowne; for they reach but to the middle of hir traine or nether part: hir legges proportionable, and of the colour of hir belly, but hir two hind-legges more yellow: hir nether part so long, and halfe so long as hir upper part, more picked then a small Bees, having it in foure joynts or partitions, and in each joynt a golden barre, in stead of those three whitish ringes which other Bees have at their three partitions. The speere she hath is but little, and not halfe so long as the other Bees: which, like a Kings sword, is borne rather for shewe and authority, than for any other use: For it belongeth to hir subjects as well to fight for her, as to provide for her. \Nat.hist.li.II.cap.17./ *Plinie/* writeth thus doubtingly of it: *Non constat inter authores Rex nullumne solus habeat aculeum, majestate tantum armatus, an dederit eum quidem natura, sed usum eius illi tantum negaverit: illud constat imperatorem aculeo non uti./* 
But *Aristotle/* doth truely approve the later opinion, as certaine: \Hist.an.l.5.cap.21./ *Reges aculeos habent, sed non utuntur. Quo circa carere eos aculeis nonnulli existimant./*  *Plinie/* describeth them thus, *Omnibus forma semper egregia, & duplo quam cæteris major, pennæ breviores, crura recta, ingressus celsior, in fronte macula quodam diademate candicans: Multum etiam nitore a vulgo differunt./* If you desire to see this stately Prince, read *cap/*.5.*n/*.27 The breeding of her you may see *c/*.4.*n/*.18. \Nat.hist.l.11.c.16./

\10 *Bees have also inferior Governors or Captaines./*/ \11 *Which are knowne by peculiar markes./*/
Besides their Soveraigne, the Bees have also subordinate Governors and Leaders, not unfitly resembling Captaines and Coronels of Souldiors: For difference from the rest they beare for their crest a tuft or toffell, in some coloured yellow, in some murrey, in manner of a plume; whereof some turne downeward like an Ostrich-feather, others stand upright like a Hearn-top. And of both sorts some are greater
[cw: and]

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees,/*/$

and some lesse, as if there were degrees of those dignities among them. In all other respects they are like to the vulgar. These I think are they that *Plinie/* meaneth, where he saith, *Circa regem satellites quidam, lictoresque, assiduæ custodes authoritatis./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.17/ In lesse than a quarter of an houre you may see three or foure of them come forth of a good stall; but chiefly in *Gemini,/* before their continuall labour have worne these ornaments. So that he might well say \Plin.Nat.hist.li.II.c.5/ *Rempublicam habent, consilia, ac duces./* All which hee that seriously considereth, must with admiration acknowledge that singular wisedome, order, and government in them, which in no other creature, man onely excepted (if yet to be excepted) is to be found: whence some have inferred a farther matter, 
\Vir.Geor.4/ 
*His equidem signis atque hæc exempla sequuti, 
Esse apibus partem divinæ mentis, & haustus 
Æthereos dixere--/* 
\12. *Two sorts of Bees./*/\Hist.l.5.c.22./\Hist l.9.40/ *Aristotle/* maketh two sorts of Bees, the one (which is best) short, divers coloured, and round; the other long like unto waspes. *Optimum genus apum quæ breves, variæ, & in rotunditatem compactiles; secundæ quæ longæ & vespis similes./* And in an other place he putteth a difference betweene wilde and tame: saying, *Differunt inter se apes parentibus natæ urbanis, & qua rustico montanoque victu educatis prodierint: sunt enim hæ sylvestres horridiores aspectu, & iracundiores, & minores; sed opere & labore præstantiores./* \Hist.l.9.c.40./ Whom *Plinie/* followeth almost *verbatim:/* saying *Apes sunt etiam rustica sylvestresque, horridæ aspectu, multo iracundiores; sed opere ac labore præstantiores. Urbanarum duo genera: optimæ breves, variæ, & in rotunditatem compactiles; deteriores longæ, & quibus similitudo vesparum, etiamnum deterrimæ ex iis pilosæ./* \Nat.hist.li.11.c.18./
But these differences my experiece hath not found: neither doe I see how they can be; seeing the swarmes of tame Bees doe often flie into trees, and so become wilde; and the swarmes of wilde Bees are not seldome found, and put into hives. Indeed the wilde are more angry then the tame: but that is because they are lesse used to the company of men. Moreover, there is some difference in the bignesse of Bees: For they that are loaded seeme greater and longer then those 
[cw: that]

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

\13 *The parts of a Bee./*/The severall parts of a Bee have their several uses. 
\14 *Hir hornes./* Hir hornes growing in the middle of hir forehead, with two joynts, one close to the head, the other towards the middle, so that she can put them forth at full length when shee will, and drawe them in againe close to hir head; are the proper *organum/* of the sense of feeling; by which, with the least touch, the Bee sodainely senteth any tangible object: and therefore they serve to give warning in the darke, and when shee is busie, of any obvious thing quicke or dead that might offend her. 
\15 *Hir eyes./*/ Hir two cheekes being transparent, like Lanthorne, doe serve, though immoveable, in stead of Eyes: through which the species of things visible are conveied to the common Sense. 
\16 *Hir fangs./*/ For gathering hir provision, shee hath two instruments, hir fangs and hir tongue: hir fangs in fashion of a paire of pincers hang not, as the jawes of other things, one over an other, but side-way one against the other, as is most convenient for hir uses. 
\17 *Hir tongue, with the parts of it/*/ Hir tongue is of that length, that hir mouth cannot hold it: but being doubled between hir fangs under hir chinne, it reacheth to the necke. It is divided into three parts: whereof the two outmost serve as a case to cover the third, which being the chiefe, the Bee in hir worke putteth forth beyond the other, and draweth in againe as she will. And this third part is likewise parted into three, so that there are five in all. 
\18 *Her foure wings./*/ To set these instruments on worke, Nature hath furnished her with 4. wings, which swifter then the East-winde, carry her into all the foure coasts of the world, and thence

with hir precious lading beare her backe againe, untill hir incessant labour hath worne them out. *v.n./*56.
\19 *Hir feete/*/ Hir rough and dew-clawed feet apt to take hold at the first touch are in number sixe, that shee may stand fast upon foure, while she useth the other two to wipe her eyes, hir wings, hir tongue, or any other part, and to convay the gathering of hir fanges to hir thighes. \*v.c./*6 *n./*16.18./ 
\20 *Hir two weapons/*/ For hir defence she is doubly weaponed. \21 *Hir fangs commonly used against insecta./*/ Hir fanges she useth when she is not much angry, against al *insecta/*, as other Bees, Drones, Waspes, &c. therewith pinching and holding them commonly by the legs or wings, and some time by the hornes: but this is rather a chiding, than a fighting, and a warning, rather than a punishment; though withall sometime she bend her speere against them, as if shee would kill and slay. 
\22 *Hir speere sometime./*/ Hir speere she is very loth to use, if by any other meane she can shift hir enimy, as knowing how dangerous it is to hir selfe: for if she chance therewith to strike any hard part, as the brest or shoulder, shee is enforced to leave hir speere behinde her, and so she killeth and is killed *v./* \*V.n./*31./ with the same stroke. Yet when the Bees are very angry; as namely when they are assalted with a multitude of robbers at once, *v/*. \v:c.7.n.36/ or when in the spring a hungry stall forsaking his owne home presseth into their hive, *v/*. \v.c.n.49/ they fall sodainly upon them with their poisoned speeres (*Apibus natura cuspides dedit, & quidem venenatas/*) \Nat.hist.li.21.c.13./ but then they make short worke. For by that time they have put up their weapons, some die presently: \23. *Stinging present death to Bees./*/ others losing the use of their wings tumble on the ground like mad things, untill in a while they lose their lives too: others when they are wounded runne away in great haste (as having their errand) either drawing on the ground one or more of their legs, or doubling their nether part toward the ground, or turning the same awry to the one side or the other: but as many as are striken, within an houre after will not bee able to wag out of the place, and within two or three at the most, they will be quite dead. I have looked on, while thus they quickly cut off a whole stall, and among them the rest, making then no difference, they spared not

the Queene her selfe. After this maner doe they deale with the Drones at the time of the yeere, when they wil not otherwise be beaten away. 
\24 *The speares commonly used against other creatures./*/ But their speares or stings they use chiefly against things of other sort, as men, beastes, and fowles, which have outwardly some offensive excrement, as haire or feathers, the touch wherof provoketh them to sting: \25 *Haire & feathers cause the Bees to sting./*/ although such stinging be alwaies mortall to themselves (as anone is shewed. *v/*) \*v.n.31/*/ For the skinne having received the sting, holdeth it so fast, that when they would be gone, they leave both it and part of their entrals which are fastned to it. *Aculeum apibus natura dedit ventri consertum/*. \Nat.hist.l.II.c.18/ If they light upon Poultry, although their desire bee to the quicke, if they can quickly come at it; yet will they put forth their speares as soone as they touch the feather: and if they chance to hit the hard part thereof, the sting sticketh fast, as in the skinne; and therefore Goose-wings are naught to be used in the hiving of Bees. 
Likewise, if they light upon the haire of your head or beard, (save onely when they come home loaden, or the weather is cold) they wil sting, if they can reach the skinne; \24 *Wooll and woollen doe not offend them./*/ although Wooll and Woollen doe not offend them: and if being otherwise angered they strike their speares in Woollen, they can easily pull them out againe. \27 *Fustian, Leather, and Velvet naught among Bees./*/ But the nap of new Fustian displeaseth them, because it seemeth hairy; and the stuffe is so fast, that it holdeth the sting. Wherefore such apparell is not fit among Bees: as also Leather in Gloves or otherwise, for assone as they touch it they will strike, if they be any whit mooved, and their speares they cannot recover againe. Velvet in facing of hats or else-where, doth anger them as much as any thing, making them strike assone as they touch it: but it hath not power to hold their speare. \28 *The Bees in their anger aime at the head./*/ When they are angry, their aime is most commonly at the head, and chiefly about the eies, as knowing that there they may do most harme, for that part swelleth most and longest: and yet I never heard that any ever stung the verie eye, as if they were forbidden to touch that tender part.

\29. *When any is stung, the company must be gone./*/ When you are stung, or any in the company, yea though a Bee have striken but your clothes, specially in hot weather, you were best be packing as fast as you can: for the other Bees smelling the rancke savour of the poyson cast out with the sting, will come about you as thicke as haile: so that fitly and lively did he expresse the multitude and fiercenesse of his enemies, that said *They came about me like Bees./* Then is there no way to appease them but flight, the more you resist, the fiercer they are. They are like unto incorrigible shrewes: there is no dealing with them but by patience: though when they sting they are sure to have the worst. \30 *The Bees have the worst when they sting./*/ For the wound endangereth nether life nor limb: two nights sleep will take away the swelling, and two minutes the paine (unlesse it be in verie rheumaticke or humorous bodies: of which sort I have knowne some so swollen and disfigured with that little stroke, that you could scarce knowe them by their favour in five or six daies after.) \31 *They lose their sting and entrals, and consequently their lives./*/ But on the other side, whereas the Waspe, Hornet, and Dorre, doe sting often without any hurt to themselves, the Bee never stingeth but once and then shee leaveth hir speere and entrals, more or lesse behinde her, *Animamque in vulnere ponit./* \*Virg. Georg./* Hist.an.l9.c40./ *(Intereunt quæ percusserint, quoniam sine intestini eruptione aculeus eximi non potest.)/* For within fowre and twentie houres after, or, if much of hir entrals come forth with the sting, within halfe that time, she dieth: \32. *The speere of it selfe pierceth deeper when the Bee is gone./*/ But the speere reteining life when the Bee is gone, if it be not presently pulled out, will worke it selfe into the flesh up to the hard end, and so cause the paine and swelling to bee both greater and longer. 
\33 *How to prevent the paine and swelling./*/ Therefore when you are stung, instantly wipe off the Bee, sting and all, and wash the place with your spittle: so shall you prevent both paine and swelling, which otherwise nothing but time can cure: for the poison is so subtill, that it quickly pierceth the flesh, \34. *Nothing but time can cure their stinging./*/ and the wound so little that no Antidote can follow after: and yet I have heard commended for a remedie the juyce of Houseleeke, of Rue, of Mallowes, of Ivie, of a Marigold

\37. *Safer to walke, then stand among Bees./*/ At any time, when nothing hath angred them, one may boldly walke along by them: but if he stand still before them within the space of a pearch in the heat of the day, it is marvell but one or other spying him from the Hive, will have a cast at him. 
\38. *The fittest time to stirre about Bees./*/ If you have any thing to doe about your hives, the fittest time is in the morning, when the Bees are new gone abroad; and in the evening before they be come in: for then the weather being coole, and the company few at home, they are not so apt to be quarrelling, unlesse they be much provoked. Likewise at other times of the day, when the weather is cold, wet, or windie, they are patient enough.  
\39. *In the heat of the day they are most angry./*/ But about noone in hot weather, and specially when they have tasted of the Hony-dewes, they are soone angrie, and very eager. 
\40. *How to bee armed when the Bees are angrie/*/ But whensoever you have occasion to trouble their presence, or to come among them being troubled, it is better to stand upon your guard, then to trust their gentlenesse. For the safeguard of your face (which they have most mind unto) provide a purs-hood made of course boultering, to be drawn and knit about your collar: which, for more safetie, is to bee lined against the eminent parts with Woollen-cloth. First, cut a peece about an inch and a halfe broad, and halfe a yard long, to reach round by the temples and fore-head from one eare to the other: which being sowed in his place, joyne unto it two short peeces of the same bredth under the eyes, for the balls of the cheekes: and then for another peece about the bredth of a shilling against the top of the nose. In stead of this, you may use a Cypres Band or a Boulter, having a Handkerchiefe betweene your fore-head and it, to beare it out from the skinne, and your hat on your head to hold it fast. And if they be so earnest that you feare stinging your hands, put on a paire of woollen cuffes or gloves. Wen you have on this Helmet and Gantlets, as a man armed at all points, you may boldly deale with them, being out of

the danger of their poysoned speares. At other times when they are not angried, a little peece halfe a quarter Broad to cover the eyes and parts about them, may serve: for then, though it be in the heat of the day, unlesse they may strike about the eyes, they care not to strike at all.
\41. *Bees dangerous to Cattell./*/ Unto Cattel which have not the reason by flight or otherwise to save themselves they are more dangerous. A Horse in the heat of the day looking over a hedge, on the other side whereof was a stalle of Bees, while hee stood nodding with his head, as his manner is, because of the Flies, the Bees fell upon him and killed him. Likewise I heard of a Teeme that stretching against a hedge overthrew a stalle on the other side, and so two of the Horses were stung to death. I doubt not but through negligence many mischances have happened else-where. For this thing hath beene long since observed by that great Philosopher. *Necant/* (saith he) *vel maxima animalia ictu sui aculei: jam equus occisus ab apibus est./* \Arist.hist.an.l.9.c.40./
\42 *The Bees senses./*/ \Nat.hist.Ii./ And such are the sorts of Bees, with their integrall parts. Among which, though there do not appear those outward *Organa/* of senting which other *Animals/* have, nor is seene in the head that inward principall + part, which is the fountaine and seat of all Senses, Phantasie, and Memorie; yet have they the Senses themselves, both outward and inward: which their subtill and active spirits doe excite and quicken, for the works of their curious Art and singular Vertues. *Quamvis non sint membra quæ, velut carina, sensus invebant; esse tamen his auditum, olfactum, gustatum, eximia præterea natura dona, solertiam, animum, artem quis facile crediderit. Creat Deus minima corpore acuta sensii animantia: ut majori attentione stupeamus agilitatem muscæ volantis, quam magnitudinem jumenti gradientis./*
\43 *Their sight dim./*/ Of all the five senses their sight seemeth to be weakest: & weaker when they come home loaded, then when they are leere: and being loaded weaker on foot, then when they are flying. If, when they come home loaded, they light beside the doore, they will goe up and downe seeking for it, as if they were in the darke: and unlesse by chance they hit upon [cw: it,]

it, they must flye againe before they can finde it. As many as fall beside the stoole when it waxeth darke, ten to one they lye abroad all night: yea, if at such time being troubled by any thing they come forth from the stoole, though then they be fresh and lustie, they will leape up and downe, runne and flie to and fro, till they be wearie; but by no meanes can they finde the way in againe. And therefore it is that when they flie abroad, they take such paines at the doore in rubbing and wiping their glazen eies, that they may the better discerne their way forth and backe. 
\42 *Their smelling very quicke./*/ But their smelling is excellent, whereby when they flie aloft in the aire, they will quickly perceive any thing under them that they like, as Honie, Rozin, or Tarre, though it be covered: As soone as the Honie-dew is fallen, they presently winde it, though the Oakes that receive it *v./* \*V.c.6.n/*.41/ be a far off: which the Poet, speaking of the excellencie of some creatures in this sense before others, doth thus expresse, 
\Lucret.l.4./ ——*Ideoqe per auras 
Mellis apes, quamvis longè, ducuntur odore./*
And by this sense they finde out any strange Bee, which is not otherwise to be knowne from their owne company, and that in the darke Hive: where, when they are disposed, they will by the same meanes cull out the Drones, yea and pull out the Cephens *v./* \*V.c.4.n.30./*/ that are shut up in the cells, not medling with an of their own Sex. 
\45. *Hearing and feeling./*/ Their hearing and feeling are verie quicke. If you touch their Hive but lightly, or the stoole, or the ground neere it; they presentlie perceiving it, make a generall noise: although \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40./ *Aristotle/* doubt whether they heare, or not. *Quanquam incertum est an audiant./* But if they did not heare, to what purpose is that musicke made in the Hives, before the swarming? *v.c. 5. n 28./* and in the battaile, *vid.c.7.n.34./* or his tinging of swarmes to make them come downe, *v:/* {manicule} in *c.5.n.37./*
\46 *Tasting./*/ And of their fift sense I make no question, sithens they are used to things of so different tastes: although there may seeme the lesse use of it, because their smelling is so perfect.

And yet I have read of a greater knowledge then all this: How there were Bees so wise and skilfull, as not only to descrie a certaine little God a mightie, though he came among them in likenesse of a Wafer-cake; but also to build him an artificiall Chappell. If I should relate the Storie, all men, I know, would not beleeve it: notwithstanding, because every man maie make some use of it, you shall have it. 
\50 *A strange tale concerning the knowledge and devotion of Bees./*/ A certain simple woman having some stals of Bees which yeelded not unto hir desired profit, but did consume and die of the murraine; made her mone to another Woman more simple then hir selfe: who have her counsell to get a consecrated Host, and put it among them. According to whose advice she went to the Priest to receive the Host: which when she had done, she kept it in her mouth, and being come home againe she tooke it out, and put it into one of hir Hives. Whereupon the murraine ceased, and the Honie abounded. The Woman therefore lifting up the Hive at the due time to take out the Honie, saw there (most strange to be seene) a Chappell built by the Bees, with an altar in it, the wals adorned by marvellous skill of Architecture, with windowes conveniently set in their places: also a doore and a steeple with bells. And the Host being laid upon the altar, the Bees making a sweet noise, flew round about it. 
But whether this doe more argue the supernaturall knowledge and skill of the Bees, or the miraculous power of the Host, or the spirituall craftinesse of him, whose comming is by the working of Satan with all power and signes and lying wonders, some scrupulous +Skeptick \+A Gellius, l.II.c.5./ may make a question: and presuming to examin every particular circumstance over narrowly, will make objections against the truth of the Storie: which, by their leaves, in the behalfe of my Author, I must not spare to answer. First, it may be they will object that the Host being held so long in the Womans mouth, could not choose in that space but melt and marre. 
[cw: Indeed,]

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

Indeed, if it did remaine, as it was, a Wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but being turned into flesh, the case is altered. If they shall say that because it was now Honie-harvest, at which time good stals, such as this was, are full of Wax and Honie, that therefore there could not be roome enough for a Chappell with a steeple and bells in it; I answer, that this is as weake and simple as the former. For seeing it is knowne that a Blacke-smith of *London/* did make a Locke and a Key so little that a flye could draw it; why should not the little Smith of *Nottingham/*, which doth the worke that no man can, frame a little Chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they will reply, if wee grant you this, yet how could the Bees flie about the altar in that little Chappell, seeing they are scarce able flie in so narrow a close roome as the emptie hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: haply the woman said they did but crawle. If they shall aske how the woman could see the altar with the Host standing in the Chancell, and the Bells hanging in the steeple, seeing the waxen walls were not transparent, they maie easily thinke that the Bees would give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if they shall say that those bells being made of such metall would give but a weake sounde, when they were rung to Mattins; they must consider the Parishoners dwelt not farre off. And so I thinke these captious Criticks will hold themselves satisfied. 
Unto this Storie my Author immediately addeth an other, like unto it, and as likely: how certaine Theeves having stollen the Silver Box wherein the Wafer-Gods use to lye, and finding one of them there, being loth, belike, that hee should lye abroad all night, did not cast him away, but laid him under a Hive: whom the Bees acknowledging, advanced to an high roome in the Hive, and there in stead of his silver boxe, made him another of the whitest Waxe: and when they had so done, in worship of him, at set houres they sung most sweetly beyond all measure about it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight, with a light and all. Wherewith the Bishop being made acquainted, came thither with many others: and lifting up the Hive he saw there

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees,/*/$

neere the top a most fine box, wherein the Host was laid, and the Quires of Bees singing about it, and keeping watch in the night, as Monkes do in their Cloisters. The Bishop therefore taking the Host carried it with the greatest honour into the Church: whither many resorting, were cured of innumerable diseases. 
I doubt not but some incredulous people wil quarrell this Storie as well as the former: making question, since the combs in the top of the Hive, are not past halfe an inch one from an other, how there could be roome for a boxe of that bredth that would containe the Host; and then being there, how it might be seene by the Bishop, seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees, and the Storie saith, that they were then singing about it: and therefore perhaps they wil suspect the whole Narration, supposing it rather to be an unadvised device of some idle Monke, which, if he had consulted with them that have skill among Bees, might have made his tale more probable. Alledging moreover, that therefore there is no mention made of my particular person, time, or place, lest the circumstances should disprove the matter it selfe. All which objections I could as easily answer as the former, if I thought it needfull; But now because some may be as ready to mistrust my relation, as others are to object against the truth of the Stories; I will here in mine owne behalfe for their satisfaction, set downe in my Authors owne words. 
*Cum mulier quædam simplicis ingenii nonnulla apum aluearia possideret, neque illæ redderent expectitum fructum, sed lue quadam tabescentes morerentur: de consilio alterius fœminæ simplicioris, accessit ad sacerdotem perceptura Eucharistiam: quam sumptam tamen ore continuit, domumque reversa extractam collocavit in uno ex alveariis.

In which Storie wee may note, besides the wonderfull knowledge and devotion of the Bees, an incredible power and vertue also. For this God which they kept and compassed, is said to have the gift of healing, which others, though of as good a making, we know doe want. The conclusion, which my Author necessarily inferreth hereupon, is better then all the rest. *Ex his necesse est dicamus in Eucharistia verum C. corpus esse./* But if thou wilt grant me that hereby is proved the incredible knowledge and skill of the Bees, for my part I wil urge thee no farther.
\51. *Temperance./*/ In the pleasures of their life, the Bees are so moderate, that perfect temperance seemeth to rest only in them. 
\52. *Justice./*/ Also, in their owne Common-wealth, they are most just, not the least wrong or injurie is offered among them. But indeed I cannot much commend their Justice towards strangers: for all that they can catch is their owne: unlesse they may bee excused in this respect, that the Bees of divers hives are at deadly feud, or rather as Kingdomes, that are at defiance one with another. *v.c.7.n.25./*
\53. *Chastitie./*/ Their Chastitie is to be admired. *Integritas corporis virginalis omnibus communis./*

Which strange kind of breeding the Philosopher saith to bee apparent unto sense and reason. \Generat.an.l.3.c.10/ *Cum in genera piscium talis quædam sit generatio nonnullorum, ut sine coitu generent; hoc idem in apibus etiam evenire videtur, quoad sensus ratioque apparens admoneat./*

\55. *The age of Bees./*/ Anent the age of Bees there are divers opinions: some thinke that they may live foure or five yeares, yea some six or seven: \Georg. 4 Hist.l.5.c.22/ *Neque enim plus septima ducitor æstas./* 
*Aristotle/* speaketh of a longer time *Vita apium anni sex, nonnullæ etiam 7; possunt complere: quod si examen 9, aut decem annos duraverit prosperè actum esse existimatur./* Which opinions are grounded upon this, that they see a stall sometimes continue so long, before the Bees die altogether.

But the truth is, a Bee is but +a yeares Bird, with some advantage.
+Which is a long life in comparison of the Silk-wormes, which live but foure moneths; or of the Waspes, which live but five: or of the Drones, which but six.
\56. *The difference betweene the young Bees and old./*/
For the Bees of the former yeare, which until *Gemini/* in the next yeare doe looke so youthfully, that you cannot discerne them from their full growne Nymphes, which that spring they have bred; doe from thenceforth change with manifest difference: for the young Bees continue great, full, smooth, browne, well-winged; the old waxe little, withered, rough, whitish, ragged-winged: and withall so feeble, that when they come loaded home, if any thing stand in their way, yea many times, though there be nothing, they fall downe, and being loaded cannot rise againe: and then either a little cold or wet in the day, or the nights dew killeth them: you may daily finde, specially in *Cancer/* and *Leo/*, some dead, some halfe-dead before the Hives, and some alive and lustie, which yet can never rise againe. Some of them will holde out so long, till their wings are more than halfe worne: but by *Libra/* you shal scarce see one of them leaft. 
\5. *The offices of the young Bees./*/ The young Bees, as best able, beare the greatest burdens: for they not only worke abroad, but also watch and ward at home both early and late: when need is, they hazzard their lives in defence of the rest, they beat away the Drones, and fight with other Bees and Waspes, and assault with their speeres whatsoever else offendeth them, they carrie their dead forth to be buried, and performe all other offices. \58. *And of the old./*/ But the labour of the old ones is onely in gathering, which they wil never give over, while their wings can beare them: and then when they cease to worke, they will cease also to eat: such enemies are they to idlenesse. And therefore generally they die in their delightfull labour, either in the field or comming home: *Atque animas sub fasce dedere./* \Virg./ Sometimes as well in Summer as Winter *v./*\*V.c.3.n.59.&62./*/ the Bees take pleasure to play abroad before the Hive, specially those that are in good plight, flying in and out, and about, so thicke, \59. *Bees wont efsoones to play./*/

\60. *They are soone killed with cold./*/ The Bee is by nature very tender, soone chilled and killed with cold, which the Dorre the Waspe, yea the Moth, the Gnat, and other little flies can endure, and most of all then, when by reason of long restraint their bellies are over full.

#CHAP. II/#
#*Of the Bee-Garden, and Seats/* for the Hives./#


\1. *Of five things requisite in a Bee-garden, the first is that it be night at hand./*/ 
{F}Or your Bee-garden, first choose some plot nigh your home, that the Bees may be in sight and hearing; because of swarming, fighting, or other suddaine hap, wherein they may neede your present helpe. While the stalls are few, your Garden of Hearbs and Flowers will serve. *Hortis coronamentisque, maxime alvearia & apes conveniunt, res præcipui quæstus compendiique cum favit./* \Nat.hist.li.21.c.12./
\2. *That it be safely fenced from cattell and winds./*/ 2. See it bee safe, and surely fenced, not onely from all Cattell, (which if they breake in, may quickly spoile both the Bees and themselves) and specially from Swine (which by rubbing against the Hives, and tearing the hackles in a wantonnesse, are most apt to overthrow the stalls;) but also from the violence of the winds: that when the Bees come laden and wearie home, they may settle quietly.*v.n.5./* 
\3. *The North and East fences should be high./*/ The North fence of your Garden should bee close and high, that the cold wind of that coast, (which blowing against the Bees coming home wearie, would throw downe 
[cw: and]

===

$*Of the Bee-Garden,/*/$

and kill many) may bee altogether kept from them. And therefore, if it may be, set your Bees on the South side of your house. 
The East-fence also would bee good and high to keepe from the Bees as well the sunne, as the winde. For the sunne rising doth oftimes till them forth, when the ayre is colder then they can endure; and the East-wind being cold & sharp is very unkinde for Bees, specially in the Spring. 
\4. *The South and West fence must be also good but not so high as to hide the Sunne from the Hives./*/But in no wise let the place be shadowed from the South-sunne: for that doth not onely dry the Hives and relieve the Bees in the Winter and Spring, but also causeth them to swarme in Summer, if it be not extreme hot and drie *v./* \*v.c./*5.n.19./
Nor yet from the Sunne-setting: because in calme and pleasant weather the Bees will be in field after the Sunne is downe, even as long as they can there see: and if they returne, they finde it darke at home, many of them, their sight being but dim, *v/*. \V.c.1.n.43/ fall short or wide: which flying and running to and fro till they be wearie, at length yeeld to the cold dew. 
Otherwise let the fences be as good against the South and West-winds also, as may be: for although they be not so cold and bitter as the other; yet are they no lesse violent, and more frequent: so that they also doe do much harme, specially in the Spring. 
\5. *In rough winds Bees need a skreene./*/ And therefore if at that time of the yeare, in rough and boistrous winds, you finde that the Garden-fences doe not sufficiently guard and defend them; then it is good to set up wixed or lined hurdles, or some other skreene betweene them and the weather. For though they can shift abroad in the strongest winds, as a ship that has sea-roome; yet are they easily overthrowne at the Hive, as a shippe is soone wrecked at the Haven. 
\6. *That it be sweet/*/ 3. That the place be sweet, not annoyed with any stinking savour. I have knowne a stall in the Spring being sufficiently provided of Honie, and having bred young, to forsake all, because of Poultry that roosted in a tree over them.

\Nat.hist.li.II.c.18./ \Nat.hist.li.21.c.12/ 
*Odêre fœdos odores, proculque, fugiunt/*: And yet the smell of urine doth not offend them: nay, they wil bee very busie where it is shed. It is thought they use it for Physike. *Remedium contra alvi concitationem est urina hominum vel boum./*
\7. *Neither very cold in Winter, nor over hot in Summer./*/ 
4 That it be neither verie cold in Winter, nor very hot in Summer. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Locus æstate non fervidus, hyeme tepidus, v:/* \*V./*{manicule}*in c.3.n.36/*/ A bare flower is naught in both seasons: because in Winter it is over cold, and by that meanes quickly chilleth the Bees that light upon it; and in Summer it causeth them to lie forth through excessive heat, *v./* \v.c.5.n.19./ A grassie ground therefore is best at all times: but let it be kept notte in Summer, and not wet in Winter: \8. *A grassie ground is best kept notte and drie./*/ for long grasse and weedes about the Hive, doe but harbour the Bees enimies, *v./* \*v.c.7.n.3/*/ and hinder both their passage in and out, and their rising againe when they fall short: and water if it stand, as it will be offensive to your selse, so is it dangerous to your Bees for chilling and drowning them. And as the parts about the hives are to be kept notte & bare; so are other places also, where the wsarmes doe use to play and pitch, whether within or without the Garden, to bee freed likewise from long grasse and weedes, much more from Beanes, Pease, Hempe, and such high things: for the young weake Nymphs falling in those shadie places, except the weather be warme and drie, are in danger to be chilled before they can rise againe. For which cause the swarmes doe usually refuse to stay and settle about such places: and then if windie or cloudie weather suffer them not to goe further, they must either goe home, or light upon some other Hives: where, without your present skill and diligence, they are like to be all lost.
\9. *Beset with trees and bushes./*/ 5 That it be conveninently beset with trees and bushes fit to receive the swarmes, as Plum-trees, Cherry-trees, Apple-trees, Filberds, Hazels, Thornes, &c. Which they will the more delight to light upon, if, convenient boughes hanging out alone from the bodies, the twigs below standing in their way be pruned, and the weeds and grasse underneath be cut away close to the ground. Although, if they be willing to stay, they will not refuse a dead hedge, a Lavender Border, or the like, or sometime the bare ground. For want of trees, 
[cw: some]

===

$*Of the Bee-Garden,/*/$

some have stucke up greene boughes, and the Bees have lighted upon them. 
\10. *Two sorts of seates/*/ The place being thus fitted, the seates are to be provided: which, whether they be stooles or benches, must be set a little shelving, that the raine may neither runne into the hive, nor stay at the dore. 
\11. *The benches not so good as single stooles./*/ To set many stals upon a bench (as many use to do) is not good: for that in Summer it may cause the Bees to fight, as having easie accesse on foot to each other, and standing so neere that they shall sometime mistake the next Hive for their owne: and in Winter the bench wil bee alwaies wet, which looseth the cloome, rotteth the bottome of the Hive, and offendeth the Bees: and the Mouse *v./* \*V.c.7.n.2./*/ at all times hath free passage from one to an other, without feare.
\12. *Swarmes may be set on benches/*/ The single stooles therefore are best. And yet it is not amisse to set most of your swarmes upon benches, about the old stalls: from whence remove them to the stooles, when the stalls are taken: and then set up the benches till an other yeare. 
\13. *Woodden stooles better than they of stone./*/ The best stooles are of wood: those of stone are too hot in hot weather, and (which is worse) too cold in cold. 
\14. *The size of stooles./*/ For their size, they should not be above halfe an inch or an inch without the Hive: save onely before, where there needeth the space of three or foure inches, that the Bees may have roome enough to light upon: specially then, when the sight of a rainy cloud sendeth them thronging home. Which fore-part from one side to the other, is to be cut shelving that it may the better avoid the raine. And therfore if the Hive be fifteene inches over, the stoole shoulde not be above sixteene or seventeen inches one way, and nineteene or twentie at the most the other way. 
\15. *Which way the stooles should be set./*/ These stooles would be set toward the South, or rather a point or two into the West: that the Hive may somwhat 
[cw: breake]

===

$*and Seats for the Hives./*/$

breake the East-winde from the doore, *v./* \v.not.3./ and that the doore may be lightened by the Sunne-setting when they returne late and loaded from field, *v./* \v.not.4./ and therefore it is to be wishes that the Garden-fences did stand accordingly.
\16. *How neere to each other./*/ They should stand in straight rankes or rewes from East to West, five foot one from another (measuring from doore to doore) and from North to South, six foot one before an other.
\17. *How neere to the fences./*/ Likewise let them stand as farre from three of the fences, as they doe one from an other. And for a plot of fiftie foot square, will receive seven rankes of nine stooles a peece, with the space of eight foot before them: which if it were bigger, were so much the better. 
For want of roome or stooles, or wit, many doe set their stalls neerer together. But the greater distance is much better: not onely that you may have roome enough to goe round about every one, to see and mend what is amisse; but also that the Bees, when they come home in haste, specially when a swarme doetg backe againe, may be sure to flie into their own Hive. For if they stand neere together, at such time many will take the next Hive for their owne, and then they fall together by the eares; *v./* \*V.c.5.n.79./*/and the Nymphs, when they go first abroad, wil by that occasion the sooner mistake: which if they doe, they dye. 
The manner of placing the stooles in your Garden, with the distance of the rankes, I have here expressed.

\18. *Annus climactericus./*/ This Climactericall number of nine times seven, is a competent or rather complete store for any one Garden, though large and alone: which being well ordered, will yeeld the Bee-master the better part of a liberall maintenance: if any be so happy to attaine unto it. So that I see no evill at all in this Number: although the sixtie three yeare of mans age being likewise called *Climactericall/*, (because it ariseth of nine Septenaries, as so many Climacters or Ladder-rounds) be counted of some, and those no small fooles too, a parles and ominous time: more dangerous for death, then all the

other yeares of their life+. For which conceipt if you see no reason; thinke it is grounded upon good observations: for this is certaine, that a ladder of nine rounds hath beene fatall unto many. 
+Ptolomæus *obliquè eos notat, qui climactericus annos faciunt ex numerorum sola observatione, ut enneadicos & hebdomaticos. Unde multis molesta senibus superstitio super anno sexagesimo tertio, quoniam peius angui tigrideque formidant: sed peccat in his vulgus errore veniali, qui Philosophi esse volunt, quis excusaverit?/* Pic.Miran.Lib.6.c.19.
\19. *The Bees Register./*/ Answerable unto this climactericall squadron it is meet you have at hand a *Register/*, containing the severall ages and yearely increases of all your stalls.Whereby you may be directed every yeare, which are to be taken and which to be kept for store: *v:/* which is the chiefe point of a thriving Bee-master. This register may bee a *Synopsis/* or Table drawne upon a sheet, or half sheet of Paper, divided into sixtie three squares, or as many as be needfull for the stalls in your Garden: having first the foure Coasts, *E.S.W./*and *N./* noted in the out-sides: secondly, the middle rew of squares from *S/* to *N./* distinguished by Letters, the first square being marked above with D, the second with C, and the third with B, which are Southerne: The fourth (being the chiefe and middle-most, unto which all the squares in the Table have reference) with A, the fift with B, the sixth with C, the seventh with D, which last three are Northerne: and thirdly, the first rew of squares next the Letters on both the *E/* and *W/* side, noted in the top or South-part with one I, the second on both sides with II, the third with III, and the fourth with IV. 
The Table thus drawne, when you have set a swarme upon any stoole in the garden, marke in what letters ranke it is, what number from the Letter, and whether Eastward or Westward: and in the square answering thereto begin his Register, setting downe first the two last figures of the yeare of the Lord, then for a prime swarme, a double circle, for a castling halfe a double circle, then the day of the moneth in which he was swarmed, writing M for May, J for June, *J/* for July. The next line begin with the next yeare: if he did
[cw: swarme,]

$*Of the Bee-Garden./*/$

swarme, set downe a crossed circle, and the day of the moneth: if he swarmed againe, set downe in the same lines halfe a circle, with a down-right stroke, and the day of the moneth: if he did not swarme, but were full to the doore, set downe a circle with a full point in it: if he did also lye out, set downe a circle with a blotted circle in it: if hee did neither lie out nor were full, set downe a void circle. 

{diagram}
And then doe likewise all the yeares that this stall endureth. 
When the Table waxeth full; after the vindemie make a new: taking out of the old the Register of those that live. By this meanes you may certainly know the age, and yearely increases of any stall in your Garden: and so guesse whether he be fitter to kill or to keepe. *V.c.10.p.1.n.3./*
\20.*The stooles height/*/ Also the stooles should not stand above two foot from the ground, because of the wind: nor under one foot for the dampnesse of the ground in winter, which would make the Hives moist and mustie; and for the heat of the ground in Summer, which in hot and dry weather would make the Bees lye out, and so hinder both their worke and swarming, *v./* \*V.c.5.n.19./*/
The best heighth is between eighteene and twentie inches. Yet if you have many, it is convenient that the more Northward rankes should stand higher, and the more South-ward lower, descending by degrees from two foot to one: as if there be two rewes of stooles, let the first stand two foot from ground, the next eighteene inches, & the benches or swarme-stooles one foot or lesse. *v./* \*V.n.12/*/ If there be three rankes beside the benches, let the second be twentie inches, and the third sixteene, &c. 
This unequall heighth of rankes may as conveniently be effected, though the stooles be all equall, by the unequall levelling of the ground: which in a great Bee-fold is best. 
\21. *How to be footed./*/ The stone-stooles must be footed as they may: the fashion of each place where they are used will direct you. But the plankes or woodden stooles are either to have foure feet made of the heart of Oake, or of some other lasting Wood; [cw: or]

===

$*Of the Hives, and the Dressing of them./*/$
or to be fastned to one foot with two woodden pins: which foot let be made of found timber five or six inches over; and of that length, that it may be set betweene fifteene and eighteene inches in the ground.
