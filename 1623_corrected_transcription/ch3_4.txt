##CHAP. III./##
#*Of the Hives, and the Dressing/* of them./#

\1. *Two sorts of Hives./*/ {I}N some countries they use strawne Hives bound with briar: in some wicker Hives made of Privet, Withy, or Hazell, dawbed usually with Cow-cloome tempered with gravelly dust, or sand, or ashes.
\2. *Strawne Hives with their inconveniencies and remedies./*/ The strawne Hives when they are olde and loded, do usually sinke on the one side, (specially if they take wet) and so break the combes and let out the hony: for which cause first see that they be hard wrought, and then spleet them strong with a Cop, *v./* fitted to the top of the Hive.  
\3. *Wicker-Hives with their inconveninecies and remedies./*/ The Wicker Hives will still be at fault, and lie open, (if they be not often repaired) unto Waspes, Robbers, & Mise. Any of these, if shee finde but a little chap, will dig her way in: and the Mouse (unlesse the twigs bee close wrought) though she finde none. 
Both these Hives, if they be not well covered, are subject to wet: which maketh them musty, and, if it be much, rotteth the combes and destroyeth the Bees. But the heate in Summer, the colde in Winter, and the raine at all times doth soonest pierc the Wicker Hives: for which cause it is good to double-dawbe them.
\4 *Strawne Hives best./*/ All things considered, the strawne Hives are better, specially for small swarmes.

\5.* The fashion of Hives/*/The Bees do best defend themselves from cold, when they hang round together in manner of a Sphære or Globe (which the Philosophers account the most perfect figure) and therefore the neerer the Hive commeth to the fashion thereof, the warmer and safer be the Bees. But of necessitie the bottome must be broad, for the upright and sure standing of the Hive, and for the better taking out of the combs: and the top must rise some two or three inches higher then the just forme of a Globe, to stay the hackle, and to shunne the raine whcih yet, where the Hives are covered with panns, is not necessary. Otherwise let your Hives vary no more from this round figure, then needs must: as where it is whithin from the top to the skirts seventeene inches, in the middle or widest place through the center fifteene inches, and at the skirts thirteene, after this forme. 
{diagram}
This forme with his dimensions wil conteine three pecks: and the abating of one inch in each dimension, abateth a gawne in the content. 
The best I have seene are wrought by *Thomas May/* of *Sunning,/* about one mile from *Redding./*

\6. *The size of Hives./*/ Hives are to be made of any size betweene a bushell and halfe a bushell: that any swarme, of what quantity or time soever, may be fitly hived, *v/*: Lesse then halfe a bushell will not containe a competent stall; and more then a bushell is found too bigge for any company to continue, and thrive together. 
The midling size of three pecks, or within a pottle, under or over, as fitly conteining the naturall quantity of a good stall, is most profitable. 
Have alwaies Hives enough of all sorts (but most of the midling size) in store, lest they be to seeke when you should use them.
\7. *When Hives are to be made and provided./*/ The best time for making them, whether they be Strawne or Wicker, is in the three still moneths of Winter, *Saggittar. Capr./*& *Aquar. v./*  \*v.n./*54/ for then the +straw, briers, and twigs are best in season: and then it is best to provide them, because then they are best cheape.
+The best straw is most yellow without blacke spots, which is strong and tough.  
\8. *How Hives are to be fed before they receive the swarmes./*/ Your Hive being ready is thus to be dressed. First, take away all those staring strawes, twigs, and other offensive jagges that are fast in the Hive, making the in-side as smooth as may be: for these obstacles being many, if they cause not the Bees to forsake the Hive, yet will they much trouble and hinder them: you may heare them (specially in the night) scraping and gnawing three or foure daies after they be hived, yea sometime a weeke together, as though there were mise in the Hive: and in strawne Hives a long time after. 
\9. *The pruning of Hives/*/ 
If you need but few Hives you may prune them cleane with your knife: if you must use many, then, having wet the skirts with a cloth, singe or sweale the in-side: but first and last rub it well with a Rubber, which is a peece of rough grind-stone or sand-stone, as great as your hand can hold.
\10. *The spraying or spleeting of them./*/ 2. The Hive being pruned, put Spleetes in it, three or foure, as the largenesse of the Hive shall require: the upper ends whereof set together at the top of the Hive, and the nether ends fasten below in equall distance, about a handfull 
[cw: above]

===

$*Of the Hives,/*/$

above the skirt. In a wicker Hive let the upper ends rest against the middle of the staffe, & the nether ends against the parts of it betweene the Wickers; and in a strawne Hive, set the upper ends together in a Cop, and the nether ends against the broars or threads, between the third & fourth roule.
\11. *The making of the Cop, and of the Spleets./*/The Coppe is a round peece of wood an inch or two thicke, whose lower *superficies/* is flat, with a hole in the middle halfe an inch deepe, for the spleets to rest in; and the upper is convex, turned or hewed fit to the concavitie of the top of the Hive. 
And for the Spleets, take a streight hazel or willow sticke, quarter it if it be bigge enough, else slit it: then shave a smooth the clefts, and having brought them to a convenient (b) strength & length, cut the lower ends forked, to stay against the Hives sides, and the upper ends somwhat picked, and of that bignesse that they may fitly joyne in the Cop or middle of the staffe, with their backs leaning (c) hard and fast against one another.  
(a) If the Hive conteine above three peckes, it may well receive foure Spleets: otherwise three will suffice. 
(b) Stiffe enoug to keepe up the Strawne Hives from sinking, specially when they are turned. *v.c.5.n.22.&23./*
(c) If you put foure Spleets in a Hive, then cut their backes, where they must leane one against another, to square angles, such as be foure in a circle: if but three, cut them to obtuse angles, such as are three in a circle: (you may readily try them, before you put them in, by Moulds made just of those formes) and so will they stand close and firme together. The first two of three, and the first three of foure are loose: it is the last that makes all fast.
And this is a handsome, easie, and sure way of spleeting: it is also good for drawing the Combes without breaking, and for keeping the Hive from sinking and from tearing at the top. Besides which there are divers sorts of spleeting, needlesse to be rehearsed: for every Countrey hath his fashion.
\12. *The seasoning of them./*/ 3 Lastly, in swarming time season the Hives that you meane to use, rubbing them with sweet herbes such as the Bees love, as Tyme, Savourie, Marjoram, Baulme, Fenell, Hysop, Mallowes, Beane-tops,&c. And when the swarme 
[cw: is]

===

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

is setled, take the Hive that you thinke fit for it in bignesse, *v./* \*V.c.5.n./*43./ and with a branch of Hazell, Oake, Willow, or any of the foresaid herbs, but chiefly with a sprig of that tree whereon the swarme lighted, wipe the Hive cleane; and then dipping it into Meth, or faire water mixed with a little hony, or with milke and salt, or for a need with salt only, besprinkle the same.
\13. *The seasoning of an old Hive./*/ But if the Hive have beene used before, after you have pared away the wax as cleane as may be, if you thinke the former dressing will not make it sweet enough; then let a hogge eate two or three handfuls of mault, or pease, or other corne in the Hive: meane while doe you so turne the Hive, that the fome or froth, which the hogge maketh in eating, may goe all about the Hive. And then wipe the Hive lightlie with a linnen cloth, and so will the Bees like this Hive better then a new. But besprinkle it also, when you doe use it, as is shewed before. And so serve a new hive when the Bees are so froward, that they will not otherwise abide. 
\14. *How Hives are to be ordered when the Bees are in them./*/ And thus are the Hives to be prepared and Dressed, before they receive the Bees. Now will I shew you how they are afterward to be fitted and furnished.
\15. *The Hives alwaies well hackled./*/ 1. First, let them be alwaies be well covered, that they may be safe in Summer from heat, lest, the wax melting, the Combes fall downe; *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*53./ in Winter from cold, lest it kill the Bees; *v./* \*v.c./*7.*n./*54./ and at all times from raine, lest it corrupt first the Hive, afterward the Combes, and at last the Bees also.*v./* \*v.c./*7.*.n/*58./ \Nat.hist.li.21.c.14./
\16. *How to make a hackle./*/ The best cover for Hives is a thicke hackle: *Alvearia stramento operiri utilissimum./* Which is thus to be made. Take foure or five handfulls of +Wheat or Rie leased out of the sheafe: which being bound up severally, beat out the corne; and then casting away their bands, draw out the eares of each handfull longer on the one side than on the other: and putting the long sides together (so to make the Head in forme of a Pyramis or Suger-loafe, for shooting the raine) [cw: binde]

===

$*Of the Hives/*/$

binde them all in one under the eares, as hard as you can. 
\17. *The Cap of two sorts./*/The Head is to be covered or bound fast with a Cap: of which there be two good fashions, the one wreathed, the other platted.
\18. *The wreathed Cap./*/ The wreathed Cap is thus made; having bound the bundles all fast together with a thong, cord, or other strong string, lease out the sheafe almost a handfull of the strongest straw, and lay it in soake about a quarter of an houre. Being thus prepared, take out of that wet bundle a litche of 40. or 50. reedes or strawes; and laying halfe of them one way, and halfe the other, that the band may be of equall bignesse, take them up together; and then mingling one end of the litche with the middle reeds of the Head, and twisting them fast together in your hand, let the band harle or double in the very top of the Head: and so begin to binde the Head round, working downeward, and still twisting the band as you goe. When that litche is well-night wrought up, take out of the wet bundle so many more reedes prepared as before: and when you have mingled one end thereof with the end of the first litche, holding them in your hand twist them fast together: and so continue your worke, alwaies binding as hard as you can, & bearing up every roule close to his fellow. When you are come down to the string, loose it, and binde the last or lowest roule in the place thereof, making fast the end, by forcing it up between the Head and the Cap with a forked sticke and a mallet.  
\19. *The platted Cap./*/ The platted Cap is wrought contrary to the wreathed: for whereas that is begun in the crown, & wrought downward toward the right hand, and is made fast in the necke; this is begin at the necke, and wrought upward toward the left hand, and is made fast in the crowne, after this manner.
First take a litch of reedes, and having wetted and wound it a little, put it about the neck of the hackle, and knitting the ends in a half knot, girt the hackle hard with it: (your assistant holding one end, while you pull the other) then to make this collar fast, wrap each end about it, forcing them betweene the collar and the head with the forke and mallet: Otherwise you mat make a strong collar of a small 
[cw: With.]

===

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

With. The collar thus fitted to the necke, set the hackle betweene your legs, as you sit or stand, with the knot outward: and then, to begin, take up a litche of the eares (about the bignesse of the of the top of your finger) next unto the fore-said left end of the collar, and laying this end betweene it and the head, turne the top of the end downeward, and so leave it: then likewise take a third litche, and laying the second betweene it and the head, turne the second downeward, and so leave it: likewise the fourth, and so forth, working thus round, till you come to the crowne, and platting still the litches hard, and close to the head.  But when you come to the other end of the Collar, take that in for a litche. If the litches be too short for the worke, plucke them up higher about the necke as you goe. When you have wrought up to the Crowne, knitting the foure last top-litches in a true-lovers-knot, make all fast. 
\20. *The bignesse of the hackle./*/ The hackle thus made of foure or five handfulls wil conteine in compasse about the necke, close under the Cap, betweene sixteene and twenty inches: sixteene wil serve for the smaller Hives, and twenty for the greatest, although they be five feet about. 
\21. *The length of it./*/ For the length of the hackles, each one is to be fitted to his Hive, so that the skirts thereof may reach to the stoole, or within halfe an inch of it round about; save onely before, where it must be pared somewhat shorter, that the Bees passage be not hindered. 
\22. *The belt or garth./*/ And then with a small pliant Garth or Belt of Bethwyn, Bramble, Brier, or the like, gird the hackle close to the Hive+, least the wind disorder it. If there be any crooke or bout in the Belt, set that before, that the hackle, bearing in that place farther out, may shoot the water from the doore: otherwise, for that purpose, set the Belt somewhat higher before, then behinde.
+ In the Winter, place the Belt below the middle or biggest part of the Hive, to keepe it warme in extremity of cold. In the Summer above, that the nether part of the hackle hanging out from the Hive, the Hive may be the cooler: and then because the Belt will be apt to rise, it would be held 
[cw: downe]

===

$*Of the Hives,/*/$

downe to the place with two forked stickes, the fork resting upon the Belt, and the other end under the Cap.
\23. *The hackle now and then to be taken off./*/ The Hackle thus fitted and placed, is now and then to be removed, not onely to meet with Mise, Moths, Spiders, Erewigs, &c. which harbour under it, and to see what breaches the Mouse and Tit-mouse have made; but also to ayre the moist Hive: and this in a warme and windy day after much wet. 
\24. *The Hives alwaies close cloomed/*/ Next keepe the Hives alwaies close for defence of the Bees against their enimies. The best cloome for that purpose is made of Neats dung: *circumlini alveos fimo bubulo utilissimum/*: \Nat hist.li 21.cap.14./ but to harden it, temper it with Lime or Ashes, with sand or gravell, which are also good against the gnawing of Mise. With this cloome close up the skirts & brackes of your Hives: that there be no way into them, but onely by the doores.
\25. *Then seldome to be moved./*/ And being thus safely shut, move them not without urgent occasion: *v./* \*V.n./* 41.49.53.&67&.c.8.&9./ for often lifting up the Hive and letting in the open aire doth discourage the stall. 
\26. *How a Hive lifted up is to be set downe again./*/ But whensoever you are occasioned so to doe (the Bees being stirring) lest any be crushed betweene the skirts and the stoole in setting it downe againe, teele up one side with a little tile-shard, which, when the Bees are quiet, take away, and see the Hive close cloomed againe. 
\27. *The Hive-doore./*/ The Bees entrance, as anon in this Chapter is shewed, must be sometime larger, sometime lesse, sometime nothing at all. And therefore every Bee-Hive must have his Gate or Summer-doore, a Winter-doore or wicket, a Barre or shutting of the wicket.
\28. *The Gate or Summer-doore./*/ The Gate or Summer-doore must be made of that size, that the Bees in Summer, when their number is greatest, may have aire enough, with free egresse and refresse, not letting one another. The space of foure square inches is sufficient for any stall.
This Summer-doore is made thus: First cut away the lowest roule the space of five inches: and, with the Briar or Thred which bound that part, make fast both ends. Then fill up againe the two extreme halfe-inches of the space, with two Doore-posts. 
[cw: The]

===

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

\29 *Of the doore-posts, and the use of them./*/ The Doore-posts are two spleets halfe and inch broad, and five or six inches long, whereof the lowest inch is twice so thicke as the other, with a shouldering on the in-side. These Posts forced up through the middle of the roules in their place, to the shouldering, as they serve to size out the Summer-doore to his due space of foure square inches; so are they fit to receive the Winter-doore, *v:/* when it shall be joyned unto them. \*V./*n.30./
If the Hive be with the least, you may set up the Posts without cutting the roule.
In a Wicker-hive the Summer-doore is made more easily. 
Sometime, namely when a Hive us reared, moveable posts are requisite: which mat serve also at other times. A moveable Post is an inch-square peece of wood, with a shouldering above to rest against the Hive: and another in the inside of the doore to fit the wicket: the forme is this. 
{diagram}
\30. *The Winter-doore, or Wicket./*/ The Winter-doore or Wicket is made of a peece of wood, an inch and a quarter thicke, almost an inch high, and five inches long. At each end whereof cut away halfe an inch all save before, where that halfe inch in length must be at least a quarter thicke, with his full heighth to fit the doore-posts: then in the middle of the neather side, cut, through the thicknesse, a hollownesse or passage, almost halfe an inch high, and three inches long: and then there will remaine at each end of the hollownesse halfe an inch uncut, besides the two extreme halfe inches leaft a quarter thicke, and fitted to the Posts.
The fashion of which wicket you may see in this figure.

\31. *The use of it./* The use of the Winter-doore is to straighten the passage when there needeth not so much roome, that the Bees may the better keepe out the Robbers, that the Cold may have the lesse force, and that the Mice may not enter, which in winter are wont to make much spoile. *v.c.7.n.3./*
\32. *The Barre./*/ The Barre or shutting is to be made foure square of some heacy matter, as namely of Lead (that neither the rough wind nor craftie Titmouse *v./* may remove it) in +length, depth, and thicknesse fitting to the wicket: with some little hollownesse next the stoole, that may let in the aire, and not let out the Bees.
+The length may be three inches and an halfe, the thicknesse three quarters, the depth halfe an inch: and the length of the hollownesse two inches and an halfe, the depth halfe a quarter of an inch.
For want of Lead or other mettall, you may with a hammer and grind-stone fit a Tile-shard: but let that be somewhat broad, that it may lie the faster on the stoole. 
\33. *The use of it./*/ With this Barre you may shut or halfe the Wicket, as you shall see cause; to defend the Bees in the more dangerous times from Frost, Snow, Titmise, and Robbers.
\34. *The Settle./*/ It is also convenient for each hive to have his Settle before him: which may be a planke of the bredth of the stoole, and of that length that it may stand leaning from the ground to the fore-part of the stoole: that thereon the Bees may settle when they come wearie or thronging home, and so ascend to the doore; and that there they may sunne and refresh themselves being chilly and wearie. Otherwise you may make a narrow planke or boord to serve, fitting the length of it to the bredth of the stooles, and then the one edge leaning to the fore-part of the stoole, let the other bee

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

borne up with two forked stakes set fast in the ground, or by some other props. 
\35. *How to order the Bee-hives throughout the yeare./*/ Bee-hives being thus fitted with all necessaries, are afterward at divers times of the yeare to be diversly ordered. 
The *Melissæen/* yeare is most fitly measured by the Astronomicall monthes (which begin with the Sunnes entrance into the severall signes of the Zodiack, and are therefore called by their names) because as the Sunne, entring into the twelve signes, and so beginning these twelve moneths, doth notoriously alter his course, making the daies longer or shorter, the aire warmer or colder, and the earth more fruitfull or barren, making also both the *Æquinoctia/* and *Solstitia/*, in which the foure quarters of the yeare, Spring, Summer, Autumne and Winter take their beginnings; so the most notable alterations about Bees, in things either to be observed in them, or to be done for them, doe likewise fall out in the beginnings of these moneths.
But the foure Quarters the Bees begin one moneth sooner than the Astronomers. For their Spring or first quarter beginneth with *Pisces,/* when the Sunne beginneth by his quickning heat to revive the flowers, which all the dead of Winter lay buried in the ground; and the Bees having tasted thereof beginne to breed, *v./* \V.c.4.n.12./ and to increase their companies for the fruits of ensuing Summer, which from the former Summer hitherto have daily decreased: the other Spring moneths are *Aries/* and *Taurus,v.n..63.&c./*
Their Summer likewise containeth *Gemini, Cancer,/* and *Leo/*, most rich and plentifull in flowers and dewes, *v:/* \V.c.6.n.38&c./ wherewith the multiplied Bees doe now store their Cells against the penurie of Winter. *v.n./*37.
Their Autumne or Harvest, hath *Virgo, Libra,/* and *Scorpio:/* in which the Bee-masters *v/* \*v.c.10.p.1.n.2./*/ and the Master-Bees *v:/* \*v.c.7.n.25.&28/*/ doe reape the ripe fruits of many Bees labours. *v:n./*44.
And their Winter consisteth of the three *still/* moneths: *v./* in which the Bees live altogether upon thsir Summer-store, and get nothing.*v.n./*58.
Heere note, that although Winter and Summer doe pro-

perly betoken two of the 4. quaarters of the yeare; yet sometime they be taken, according to the common account, for two halfe parts or moities thereof: the one containing the warmer season, as from the end of *Aries/* to the end of *Libra,/* the other the colder, as from the end of *Libra/* to the end of *Aries./*
+Namely, when they are mentioned together in a kind of opposition: as c.2.n.7. where you reade, neither very cold in Winter, nor very hot in Summer. *Locus æstate non servidus, hyeme tepidus, &c./* Which two opposite parts the Poet doth fitly distinguish and describe by the two times of fodering and of pasturing Sheepe and Goats.
*---Victumque feres & virgea lætus/*
*Pabula, nec tot â claudes fœnilia Bruma:/*
*At verò Zephyris quum læta vocantibus Æstas,/*
*In saltus utrumque gregem & Pascua mittes./*
\Metam.lib.6./ But they are more certainly notified by the comming of the Fieldfare, and of the Swallow: the one bringing cold Winter, the other warme Summer with her. Hir Sister *Philomela/*, that shrowdes hir selse in the yeare, then the disposition of the aire: For she is heard commonly the last weeke in *Aries,/* though it bee then cold and winterly weather: whereas *Progne/* stayeth after that untill she finde it warme abroad. If some foolish one or other chance to start out of hir Dormitorie sooner, the Proverbe then is verified, One Swallow makes not a Summer. 
\37. SUMMER./The Spring having replenished the Hives with plentie of Bees, the Summer is readie with his plentie of Honie to entertaine them. During which season the Hives must have their largest entrance. *v:/* \V.n.28./ lest the thronged multitudes be pestered for want of aire, or doe let one an other as they goe and come earnest in their worke, or bee stayed in swarming when they should passe at pleasure. Neither can the opennesse of the Hives be hurtfull unto them, seeing now there is no feare of enemies.

\38. In GEMINI *set the doores wide open./*/ set the doores wide open./ At *Gemini/* therefore set the doores *v:/* \V.n.28./ 
*Gemini/* being past, if the weather be usually coole, when there commeth a calme warme day, take off the hackles from those Hives that are likely to swarme. But if the weather be extreme hot and dry, then it is good to keepe on the hackles to coole the Hives, &c.*v.c.5.n.21./*

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

\41. *To keepe them from swarming./*/ When you would have no more swarmes, as namely after the first blowing of Blackberries, *v./* \*v.c./*5.*n/*11./ which is commonly within a seven night after Midsummer, set up those Hives that are full with three Tile-shards, or other things of like thicknesse, and cloome up the space betweene the hive and the stoole: If yet they chance to swarme, as soone as they are hived, put them backe to the stocke, *v.c.5.n.11./*
Also reare the swarmes that being under-hived doe lie forth, with bolsters of that thicknesse that may but let in the Bees. 
\42. LEO./ In *Leo/*, or presently after the last swarme, kill the Drones, of those stalls you meane to take, with a Drone-pot cloomed to the doore. *V.c.4.n.35./*
\43. *How and when to kill the Drones./*/ And if you see any other so pestered with multitudes, that they are loath to meddle with them you shall doe well to helpe them some warme afternoone, and then will they take the worke out of your hand, and spend the lesse time about it.
\44. HARVEST/ To the plentifull Summer succeedeth wastfull Autumne. 
\45. VIRGO./ At *Virgo/* therefore, or a little before, (which is the most dangerous time for Bees, because of the Waspes that then, if not sooner, learne the way into the Hives, but chiefely of robbing Bees, which then begin to spoile) *v:/* \*V.c.7.n.28./*/ and see that the Hives bee close in all places. (Those that have lien forth or otherwise be verie full, you may let alone and not straighten their entrance till the weather bee colder, for such as are safe enough.)
\47. *Set up the Winter-doores./*/ But first view your swarmes whether they fit their Hives: those that have not now wrought downe within a handfull of the stoole, if you meane to keep them (to the end they may lye warme the Winter following, and be ready at the doores to keepe out robbers) cut off so much of the skirts as will serve the turne (the bigger the Hive is, the more you may lessen him) and so set him downe, cut a Summer-doore *v:/*\*V.n.28./*/ in the skirt, and put to the Winter-doore. Without such help the cold will kill many, and weaken all, whereby they 
[cw: become]

$*Of the Hives,/*/$

become unlustie in all their doings: as the Philosopher well noted, *Si alveus justo amplior sit, desidiosiores redduntur./* \Hist.l.9.c.40./
\48. *And keepe them shut til they offer to go abroad./*/ Moreover, because the Waspes and robbing Bees will be stealing betimes, before the true Bees be stirring; it is good in the evening, when the Bees are all in, to barre up the Wickets of those that are weake, that a Bee cannot passe: and not to open the same the next day till the weather be warme, and the Bees offer to come abroad, though it be not before nine, or ten, or eleven a clock: and then you may either open it, or halfe-open it, according to the flight of your Bees, *v./* \*V.n.33./*
\49. *The reared stalls now to be set downe againe./*/ The stalls which you reared in the end of *Cancer/* for feare of swarming or want of roome, *v:/* (now that the death of the old Bees *v:/*\V.n.41./ and of the Drones *v:/*v.c.1.n.55. hath made roome) are to be set downe againe, *v:/*V.c.4.n.25.&c.V.n.26./lest their swarming be hindred the next yeare: unlesse they be swarmes that have wrought downe to the stoole. 
\50 *In Virgo try whether the Bees will live./*/ Also in this moneth, about the middle, those Hives which you deeme to be weake because the Bees are gone up from the doore, knocke with your han, one after an other: they that are first or second stroke doe make a great noise both above and neneath, continuing the same for a space, have store of Bees, and are therefore in lesse danger: but those that make a little short noise, though they be heavy and have Honie enough (such as are commonly those of three yeare old, & upward, that have cast twice or oftner that yeare, and did not by *Virgo/* beare away their Drones) yet have they but few Bees, and are therefore ill able to resist the violent multitude of Robbers: which, when they perceive their weaknesse, will never leave them, as long as there is a drop of Honie in the Hive. 
If you see them once fighting, *v/*\*V.c.7.n.45./*/ either presently take them, or make the entrance so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once: and before *Libra/* bee sure to take them. For though they escape this robbing-time through your care and diligence; yet at the Spring they will surely yeeld, or die of themselves, or flie away. Note yet, that those stalls which are very full, will make but a little noise when you knocke them, (but different from the other, as being quicke, smart,

51. *Now take the Combes./* In the end of this moneth is the time to kill and drive Bees,*v.c.10.part.1.2.&13./* Some Bees faile after *Virgo:/* and therefore it is good to make triall of them in *Libra/* also, by poysing and knocking the Hives; for as they that then make+ a little noise will die for lacke of company; so thet that are light will die for lack of meat. And alwaies have an eye to those that the Robbers doe eagerly haunt: which is a signe that they perceive in them some defect or other: and therefore will not be answered without their errand.
+A little short noise above in the Hive, specially when in the end some few single Bees endeavour by their earnest and continued sound to seeme many, bewraieth their paucity and decaying.

\54 *Now set up the wickets to the best, and keep the rest shut till the Bees offer to goe abroad./*/ At *Libra,/* or before you see cause, set up the Winter-doores of the best, and then diligently in the evenings shut all those in with the Barre, that have leaft watching at the doore. For in the cold mornings, while the true Bees keepe in, because it is not fit time for them to gather in; the theeves, both Waspes & Bees will be abroad, seeking where they may breake in and steale.

the Hives dry and warme. And now remember also to shut the wickets of them all. 
\58. WINTER./ After Autumne, the Sunne drawing neere the Winter Tropicke, with a short and low course above our *Horison,/* there follow three *still/* moneths, *Saggitarius, Capricornus,/* and *Aquarius:/* in which as the plants lie still in the earth waiting the Sunnes returne to revive them; so the Bees lie *still/* in their Hives, passing this fruitlesse time in sleepe and slumber. Yet so, that if there happen a milde and warme houre, they presently perceiving it awake out of their swivet, and hye them out of doores with all alacrity: that they may take the fresh aire, recreate themselves, drinke, exercise their wings, carry out their dead and other noysomenesse, and lighten their little bellies, which are oft times so stuffed, when the wether suffreth them not to goe abroad, that they can hold no more: so loth are they to defile their nests. And having thus refreshed themselves, at their returne, they take their repast, and then betake them againe to their rest. But many such daies, specially in time of scarcity, are dangerous, as causing them to spend much of their store, which in *still/* frosts they would spare.
\61. *The first sharpe weather in Capr. shut the Bees in./*/ The first foule and cold weather in *Capricorne/* shut the Wickets close, to save the Bees from the Tit-mouse, *v./* and from the cold, as well within the Hive as without. For as the frost and snow and cold winds, yea and the ordinary disposition of the aire doth chill many of them, whom the flattering sun-shine enticeth abroad; so the great frosts, striking through the doore doe freeze the nethermost in the Hive to death: so that by little and little many stalls in some winters have been thereby wholly destroyed: the which, by keeping them warme, might have beene preserved. But when you shut them in, be sure the Hives be alwaies close and sure: \62. *And in pleasant weather let them loose, if it may be, once a fortnight./*/ for the Bees when they awake will strive by all meanes to come forth, though they never finde the way in againe. Yet when there happenenth any pleasant day (namely when the sunne shineth, the winde is still, or bloweth mildly out of the South or West, and the earth is without frost & snow) is it is very behovefull to give them leave to play, *v./* \*v.n.59.&c.1.n.59./*/ and to refresh

themselves: once in a fortnight or three weekes is to be wished, specially after *Capricorne/* is past: but if you or the weather shut them in much longer, they will be so faint and feeble through their long restraint, that without very pleasant weather at their comming abroad, a number of them will be chilled while they rest themselves but a little in the open aire. And therefore as often as, for this purpose, the doore is a little opened; alter it not, untill the weather alter: and when *Aquarius/* is halfe spent, if, for feare of a piercing night-frost, you barre them up in the evening; let them goe againe in the morning, unlesse either snow or boysterous windes forbid you. In winter provide your Hives.*v.n.7./*
\63. *The/* SPRING./ The still Moneths of Winter being past, the new yeere entreth with *Pisces/*, the first moneth of the Spring: when the Plants begin to sprout, and the Bees to breed againe.  
\64. PISCES./ 
\65. *The first faire day in Pisces, set the Bees at libertie./*/ Now therefore, if not sooner, the weather being faire, halfe open the wickets of the better sort, and so let them stand day and night. For the night-cold, being now shorter and weaker, is not dangerous to such: and the day-cold doth them more good then hurt, causing them to lie still and spare their store, untill it be fit time to goe abroad. But for the weaker swarmes (which are more subject to cold, and robbing that now beginneth afresh, *v./*) \*v.c.7.n.27./*/ shut them close in the evenings, and open them not in the mornings untill it be warme: and then give them but roome for a Bee or two to passe, specially those that stand most warme in the Sunneshine, which maketh the robbers able to endure the siege, whom otherwise the aires chilnesse would quickly discourage.  
\66. *Now dresse their Troughes./*/ And now (the Bees beginning to breed, *v./* \*V.c.4.n.12.&c.6.n.53./*/ is the time to dresse and fill their Troughs, which all the winter lay neglected. 
\67. *Clense the stools./*/ At this time, in a morning before the Bees come much abroad, lift up your Hives: and quickly sweeping the dead Bees and other noysomenesse away, and scraping cleane the stooles, set them downe againe, *v./* \*V.n.26./*/ and cloome them close as before. For albeit the Bees in time would rid them cleane themselves; yet shall it be good for them to have done it at

once, that they be neither hindered, nor annoyed therewith: and now and then the carrying out of a dead Bee at this time of the yeere doth cost a quicke Bee hir life: for being drawne with the weight of the corps to the cold ground; while she standeth panting a little, she is chilled, and so not able to rise any more. 
This cleansing of the stooles, after a calme *Aquarius,/* when the Bees have beene much abroad, is not so necessarie, and specially for the better stalls.
\68. *And feede or drive light stalls./*/ Those that by their lightnesse you perceive to lack honey, you may now save by feeding, *v.c.8.n.11./* or driving them into others that have store. *v.c.10.p.1.n.15./*
\69. ARIES./ 
\70. *The second chiefe robbing time./*/ *Aries/* is almost as dangerous a moneth, for robbing, as *Virgo/*: and therefore you must have a care in the evenings to shut the Wickets, & in the mornings not, before it be warm, to halfe-open them againe: and where the drie winds and hot sunne have shrunke the cloome, be carefull to fill up the chinkes againe. 
The poore stalls this moneth would be halfe-shut all the day, as in *Virgo/* and *Libra./*
\71. *In/* TAURUS *remove the bars./*/ At *Taurus/*, and sooner, if sooner you see+ cause, removing the Barres from the better stalls, set the Wickets open: and for the weaker sort, let them all this moneth be shut in the evenings: and in the mornings, as soone as it is warme, be but halfe-opened. 
+That is, when either they keepe watch at the dore in the evenings, or be so encreased that they cannot easily passe too and fro in their worke: for if the passage seeme too streight onely in their playing fit, *v.c.1.n.59./* that maketh no matter. 
\72. *In/* GEMINI *the winter doores./*/ At Gemini take away the Wickets from the better, & the Barres from the weaker stalls: and when this moneth is halfe past, make them all alike: leaving the doores as they were in *Gemini/* before. *v.n.38./*

##*Of the Breeding of Bees, and/* of the Drone./##


\1. *The Drone no labourer/*/{T}HE Drone, which is a grosse Hive-Bee without sting, hath been alwaies reputed a greedy lozell: (and therefore hee that is quicke at meat and slow at worke is fitted with this title) for howsoever he brave it with his round velvet cap, his side gowne, his full paunch, and his lowd voice; yet is he but an idle companion, living by the sweat of others brows. For hee worketh not at all, either at home or abroad, and yet spendeth as much as two labourers: you shall never find his maw without a good drop of the purest *nectar/*. In the heat of the day he flieth abroad, aloft, and about, and that with no small noise, as though he would doe some great act: but it is onely for his pleasure, and to get him a stomach, and then returnes he presently to his cheere. *Fuci cum exeunt efferunt sese fusium in sublimi gyroque volitant: quod ubi satis iam fecerint, redeunt domum, & epulis perfruuntur./* \Hist.an.li.9.c.40./ But for all this there is such necessary use of him, that hee may not be spared, as without whom the Bee cannot bee.
\2. *Divers opinions of the Drones originall./*/ The generall opinion anent the Drone is, that he is made of a hony-Bee, that hath hir sting: which is even as likelie, as that a dwarfe having his guts pulled out, should become a gyant. Others seeing the fondnesse of this opinion, have thought and taught that the Drone is a different *species,/* and that as Bees breed Bees, so Drones breed Drones: which conceit (if the Author had observed, that at the time of their breeding and many moneths before, there is not a Drone left alive to breed them) hee would have liked as well as the 
[cw: former.]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees,/*/$

former. These opinions then, being one as likely as the other, let them goe together. The truth is, they are of the same *species/* with the hony-Bee, but of a different *Sex./*
\3. *The Drone is the Male-Bee./*/ For albeit he be not seene to ingender with the hony-bee, *v./* \*V.c.1.n.53/*/ either abroad, as other *insecta/* doe, or within the Hive, (where yet you may by means behold what they do;) *v./* \*V.c.6.n.6&7/*/ yet without doubt is he the Male-Bee, by whose naturall heat and masculine vertue the hony-Bee, which breedeth both hony-Bees and Drones, *v./* \*V.n.18./*/ secretly conceiveth. 
\4. *Divers reasons proving the Drone to be the Male. The first reason is, that they are suffered in breeding time onely/*/ The reasons that move me thus to thinke, are these. First, because although they be great wasters of the Bees store, yet until they begin to leave breeding, and have conceived for the next yeere, (which some do about *Leo/*, most before *Virgo/*) they suffer them: afterward they begin to beat them away. Which if some doe not, before *Scorpio/* they die naturally: and from thenceforth all the Winter, untill the Bees breed new againe, *v./* \*v.n./*18.&19./ there is not a Drone to be had *In rerum natura/*. \Nat hist l.II.c.11./ When they are quite gone, then doe the Bees lay no more seeds that yeere, but onely hatch and breed up those that are already in the celles.
\5.*The second reason is that the Drones being taken away in breeding time the Bees breed no more./*/ Secondly, as the rather and the more the Drones are, the more and greater are the swarmes; (*Certe quo major fuerit fucorum multitudo, eo major fiet examinum proventus v./*) \*v.c./*5 *n/*4./ so where the Drones are few and late, there is small increase: and therefore if you kill the Drones of a Hive before the Bees have done swarming and breeding (as some fondly have don before Mid-sommer, to save their hony from these lazie lurchers) neither will the swarmes come forth that were formerly bred, nor the stocke thenceforth breed any more. After which time bringing in *Ambrosia v./* \*v.c./*6.*n./*18./ as much as before, and having no young ones to spend part, they lay it up carelesly in their cells, where it corrupteth and turneth to stinking stopping *v./* \*v.c./*6.*n/*19.&20./ which will cause them so much to mislike their Hive, that the next *Virgo/* they will easily yeeld it to the Robbers *v./* \*V.c./*7*n/*25/ And if by your industry they be then preserved; in *Pisces,/* when breeding time is, finding their wombes barren, and therefore loathing even themselves and all, they yeeld their goods to them that will take it: and 
[cw: after]

$*and of the Drones./*/$

after a while, when the strange Bees and they smell all alike, by conversing together in the same Hive, and sucking the same hony, away they goe with them to their Drones. But every faire day they will returne to fetch that they leaft behinde them: you may see them flie so thicke to and fro that hive, as if it were full of Bees: but when night is come, they are all gone. 
\6. *The third reason is, that they are bred by the Bees./*/ Thirdly, because *omne simile generat sibi simile/*, Every living thing doth breed Male, or Female of his kinde, and experience doth teach us that the Bees doe yeerely breed, as well Drones as honi-bees; *v./* \*V+ in annot.&n.12,&c./*/ seeing the honi-bees are females, it followeth necessarily that the Drones are the Males of the same kind. And therefore in the learned Languages the Drone hath his +Masculine appellation, as the Honi-bee hir feminine. 
+*Hic fucus [greek]: Ac hæc apis, [greek] [hebrew] cum [hebrew] fœminino. Melissa/* the daughter of *Meissus/* King of Crete, being one of *Jupiters/* nurces, is said to have beene by him transformed into the Honi-Bee: which retaineth still her gender, sex, and name. *Didymus aiit duas Melissi fuisse filias, Almatheum & Melissam, que Jovem puerum caprino lacte & melle nutrierant./* Lact.lib.1.instit.c.22. *Nec sane rustico dignum est sciscitari, fueritne mulier pulcherrima specie Melissa, quam Jupiter in Apem convertit./* Columella.lib.10.c.2.

\7. *The fourth reason is, that the wasps and dorres have drones, which are their males./*/ Fourthly, wee see the like in the likest *insecta/* the Waspe and the Dorre: for the manifesting whereof I wil briefly shew you the breeding of them both. 
\8 *The breeding of wasps by drones./*/ The Waspes neast is begun by one great Waspe, which you may therefore call the Mother-waspe: the which in *Cancer/* (or in hot and dry springs somewhat rather) within some hole, usually made in the ground by a Moale, Mouse, or other meanes, worketh a Comb of the utter drix of pales, or other timber, in forme of a round tent hanging by the top to the over-part of the hole. This combe containeth about six Cells, of the bignesse and fashion of the Bees cells, wherein she breedeth so many young ones: which, when they are fledge, doe breed as well as their dam: and so enlarge the combe to some eight inches over. Then, making more room beneath by moining and carrying out the earth, they hang an other combe under the first, by little pinns, and so an other, 
[cw: and]

$*Of the Breeding of Bees,/*/$

and an other, increasing still in the same place till Summer be done. For they goe not forth in swarmes as Bees doe. \Hist.l.9.c.42./ *Missio, ut apum, nulla vel crabronum vel vesparum fieri solet: sed qui subinde oriantur novelli ibidem manent, & alveum terrâ egestâ faciunt ampliorem./* When their breeding draweth toward an end, namely in *Virgo/* and after, (besides the small or ordinary Waspes, which lie in all the upper combes) in the last or lowest combe, made for the nonce with larger cells fit for larger bodies, they breed also two other sorts, Drones or Male-waspes (which are somewhat bigger and longer than the small Waspes, and without stings as the Drone-bees) and Mother-Waspes, which are like the small ones in all respects save that they are twice so bigge. These when they are fledge having conceived, as the Bees, by the Drones, leaving both Drones and small-Waspes to the mercy of Winter (which with his first cold-wet wether chilleth and killeth them as they flie abroad) do forthwith betake themselves to some warme place, as the thatch of an house, a mortice in a post, an auger-hole, or the like; but specially into hollow trees, (which is the cause, why in grounds adjoyning to Woods their neasts will be most rife) where they abide till the next spring without any meat, as it were in a dead sleepe: out of the which neverthelesse a little warmth of the fire, or of your hand will awake them at any time. At the blowing of Palme, if the weather be warme, they flie abroad for food: and in *Cancer/* or *Gemini/*, as I have said, they begin to nestle and breed. He that killeth one of them killeth a whole neast of Waspes. 
+When the old Mother-Waspe hath done breeding, and hir wings are so worne, that she is not able to helpe her selfe, the little ones keepe her so long as they live together. Before the young Mother-Waspes are bred, you may easily fine her among the little ones: but when they are fledge, you cannot know her from one of them, but by hir ragged wings.
[cw: And]

$*and of the Drone./*/$


And that the Drone-waspes are the males, some were of opinion in the daies of *Aristotle/* for thus he writeth. \His.li.9.41./ *Si vespam ex pedibus ceperis bombilareque, siveris, advolant quæ aculeo carent: quod non faciunt, quæ aculeatæ sunt. Itaque argumento quidam hoc utuntur quod alteræ mares sunt, alteræ fœminæ:/* which argument seemeth not unprobable, seeing the Fowlers counterfeiting the call of the Hen-Quailes catch only the Cocks.
\9.*The breeding of Dorres by drones./*/ The Dorre likewise beginneth hir neast single, being more like the Bee then the Waspe is, in that she maketh Honie, and more unlike in the fashion of her Combs: for she hath only a few round cels of the bignesse of grapes, lying flat on the ground one upon another without any order: the which are made after this manner. First either upon the ground in the grasse, or in some shallow hole within the ground, shee prepareth a little stuffe which is soft like Wax, but browne and more brittle, of the bignesse of hir head; and therein she layeth about six or seaven seedes together, compassing them round with the same stuffe: which increaseth by little and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to live, it groweth into so many severall Cells, as there are grubs, each one having one to himselfe. When they become to their bignesse, the Cells, which before were browne and brittle, doe now wax white and tough, that you can scarce teare them. And when the Dorres are ripe, they gnaw their way out at the top. Upon these they make more in like manner, and the void open Cells they fill with Honie, wherewith they feed both themselves and their young, when the weather suffreth them not to flie abroad. All this neast is covered with a little Mosse like a Birds-neast. Untill *Leo/* they breed females onely as the Waspes doe: and then last of all, for propagation of their kind, they breed their Drones, being likewise, as the Drones of Bees and Waspes, without stings. And these, to put the matter out of doubt, within a moneth after when they are ripe, doe openly engender with their females, as the chaffers doe, but their mates they choose in the neast, and are carried away by them. After which time the females breed no more till the next Summer,
[cw: though]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees,/*/$

though you may see them gathering, and flying about somewhat longer then the Qaspes. In *Saggitarius/* they betake themselves to their Winter-rest, where they lie single as the Mother-Waspe in a sleepe or swivet. But the Drone-dorres, as the Drone-waspes, are destroyed by the weather: not one afterward to be seene till next *Leo/*, when the females breed new againe. But one thing in the Dorres and Waspes is more strange, then in the Bees. For whereas the Bees assone as they have bred their first brood of females, doe presently breede Drones, *v./* \*v.n./*19/ (both which, when they are ripe, multiply together) the young Dorres and Waspes in the beginning of Summer, doe not immediately take the Drones (for then there are none) but receive from their dams, togither with their nature and being, that Masculine seed, wherby when they are ripe they breed all the Summer following, untill in the end they likewise conceive by their late-bred Drones for the next yeare, both for themselves and the young that shall come of them. 


\10. *The fift reason is the apparent signes of their Sex./*/ By this time thou wilt say with me, that the Drone is the male-Bee: Whereof if some curious Chirurgion would make an Anotomie, he should easily discerne *Duos amplos & candidos testes/*, two lawfull witnesses of his Masculine Sex.
\11. Aristotles *Objection answered./*/ This truth began to appeare many yeares agoe, even in *Aristotles/* time. *Aliqui/* (saith he) *mares esse fucos, fœminas vero apes esse contendunt./* Which opinion he reciteth in another place. *Sunt qui fuces mares esse, apes fœminas arbitrentur/*. \His l.5.c.21/\Generat.l.3.c.10./ Where though he doe not approve it; yet hath he no other resson against it but this. *Arma ad pugnam viresque exercendas nulli fœminæ a natura tribuunutur./* Nature hath armed no female for fight and force against the male: but the Bees have power and weapon to chastice the Drones: *v./* \*v.n./*22/ and therefore the Drones cannot be their males. 
The weaknesse of which reason I marvaile he did not see, seeing in all the kinde of +Hawkes the female doth command the male, as being both stronger and better armed. Whereunto may bee added the example of the *Amazons/* raigning in his time: who by force of arms subdued many kingdomes of men, and held them in subjection: like unto 
[cw: which,]

===

$*and of the Drone./*/$

which, it is marvaile but there were then some mankind Viragoes in *Greece/*, as well as there be now in other Countries. 
Which thing, if nothing else, the experience of his Masters + Master might have taught him.
+The first instance is beyond exception: neither doe I see how the other can be answered, unlesse peradventure it be replayed that such rule is against Nature. 
+*Aristotle/* his Master was *Plato,/* whose Master was *Socrates/*, whose Master was *Xantippe/* that thundring showring Queene of Shrewes. *Xantippe Socratis Philosophi uxor morosa admodum fuisse fertur & jurgiosa: irarumque, & molestiarum muliebrium per diem perque noctem scatebat./* A Gellius l.1.c.17. *Socrates, cum in eum Xantippe prius convitia & maledicta ingressisset, postea vero & sordidis aquis perfudisset, Nonne (inquit) dicebam Xantippen tonantem quandoque pluituram?/* Laertius lib: *v./* in vita Socratis.
But you mst understand that the Philsopher speaketh thus, not *dogmaticè/* but *disputatvè/*, onely by way of reasoning: for in the end of the same chapter he yeeldeth himselfe to have no certaine knowledge thereof. *Non tamen satis ad huc explorata quæ eveniant habemus./*
\12. *When the Bees begin to breed./*/ To returne therefore to our purpose, the Hony-Bees having, as those other *insecta/*, conceived by the Drones; the best about *Pisces/* when they first gather upon flowers, others in *Aries,/* and the weaker later, begin their breeding: which is continued all the Summer, even to the end of *Virgo./* But the chiefe time is in *Aries, Taurus,/* and *Gemini:/* which moneths yeeld *Ambrosia/* the *Schadons/* food, in greatest plentie, varietie and vertue. \13. *The chiefe time of breeding./*/ 
\14. *The first breed are females./*/ The Bees will be sure to serve themselves first, their first generation being alwaies females: which they breed after this manner. 
\15. *The manner of their breeding./*/Close under the Honie (which is that time altogether in the upper parts of the Combs) in the middle of the bottomes of the void Cels, as the Waspes doe on one side, they lay their seedes, about the bignesse of those which the Butter-flie leaves upon the Cabage-leaves: but of different colour, the Bees being white like Wasp-seedes, and the Butter-flies yellow. And so they descend by degrees toward the neather part of the Combes, filling one Cell after an other. Although when the chiefe breeding is past, 
[cw: they]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees,/*/$

they doe not precisely observe this order, but lay up their Honie promiscuously among the yong Bees, where they finde the Cells void. \16. *The Bee-seed is first turned into a Worme./*/ The Bee-seed at the first sticketh upon one end untill it be a live Worme or Grub: as soone as it liveth it is loose, and lyeth in the bottome of the Cell round like a ring, one end touching the other, till so the bottome can no longer containe it: after that, it lieth along in the Cell til it be growen to the full bignesse of a Bee: and then doth the Worme die and becommeth void of all motion and sense: and so is shut up in the Cell, the Bees covering the top close with wax. 
\147. *The Worme being dead groweth to the shape of a Bee and then liveth againe./*/ The Grub being now dead, presently beginneth the alteration from a Worme to a Bee: which, is two-fold, in shape and in colour: the first alteration in shape, is the division in the middle; then the other division betweene the head and shoulders, whence it is called an *insectum:/* after that, the growth of the head, legges, wings, and other parts into their shape and fashion. The first that altereth in colour from white to browne is the upper part, and of the upper part the head, and of the head the eyes.  
The uniforme shape and white colour of the Worme, being thus altered into the proportioned shape and brownish colour of a Bee, she beginneth to move agine, and to live her second life: and then breaking the cover wherewith she was inclosed in the Cell, she commeth forth a flying Bird.
 \Hist.an.i.5.c.22./ *Foetu posito incubant, exclusis inde vermiculus, dum parvus est, jacet in favo obliquus: postea sua ipse facultate se erigit, cibumque capit. Foetus apum & fucorum candidus est: ex quo vermiculi fiunt, qui in apes fucosque transeunt./* And all this within the space of a moneth. Yea in swarming-time, when the Hives have more heat, partly from the aire, and partly from the multitude of Bees; when also the *Schadans/* never want their fill of *Nectar, Ambrosia,/* and faire water continually brought in fresh and fresh unto them; I have knowne this effected in three weekes: although *Plinie/* speakes of more then twice so long a time. *Foetus intra/* 45. *diem peragitur./*

For the golden matter whereof they are made is not turned into a Worme at all; but immediately receiveth the shape of a Bee. \Hist.l.5.c.22/ *Primordium regum colore cernitur fulvo, corpulentia mellis crassoris, magnitudine ilico proximâ suæ futuræ soboli: nec primum ex eo vermiculus gignitur, sed statim apis./* Item. \Colum:l.9.c.11/ *Higinius negat ex vermiculo, ut cæteras apes, fieri ducem; sed in circuiu favorum paulo majora, quam sint plebii seminis, inveniri for amina repleta quasi sorde rubri coloris, ex qua protinus alatus rex figuratur./*
\19 *When the Drones are bred./*/ When the old Bees have ended their first broods of females, then last of all after the same manner in wider Cells made for the nonce *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*10./ they breed the Male-bees or Drones: as was long since observed, *Sunt fuci sine aculeo velut imperfectæ apes, novissemque à fessis & jam emeritis inchoatæ, ferotinus fœtus./* \20. *When they come abroad./*/ And therefore some stalls doe not dronie before *Cancer/*, not many before *Gemini/*, nor any before *Taurus/*: although you may see the +Nymphes of good stalls abroad in *Aries/*, of others in *Taurus/*, and of all in *Gemini/*. By chance some few Cephens may be bred betime with the femals: but they, as comming out of season, are not suffered to live. 
+The young Bees are called Schadons: *Schadones sobolem dico./* Hist.l.5.c.22. The brood of females, when they have the shape of Bees, are called Nymphs, and the young Drones Cephens: *Cætera turba, cum formam capere cæpit, Nymphæ vocantur, ut fuci Cephenes/* Pl.li.II.c.II.
\21. *Two uses of the Drones./*/ These Cephens or Drones, when they are fledge, doe not only serve for generation (as hath beene shewed) but also doe helpe the females much, by reason of their great heat, in hatching their broods. *In fœtu adjuvant apes, multum ad calorem conferente turba./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.II/ \22. *Where they lye./*/ And for these causes they are alwaies in breeding-time mingled with them throughout the Hive. Although afterward (when they have beene much beaten, and can goe no where single, but one or other will be on their jackes) they gather all together in a cluster, for their saftie in one side of the Hive: so that it is true at some time which the Philosopher spake indefinitely, *Tenent alvei locum penitiorem./*. \His.l.9.c.40./ And yet their hanging together will not

serve their turne: for the Bees, when they are disposed, will quickly make them part, and depart. When there is no use of them, there will be no roome for them.
\23. *The male-Bees are subject to the females./*/ For the Drones are but vassals to the Honie-bees: which as they doe excell them in virtue and goodnesse, so doe they also in power and authoritie, ruling and over-ruling them at their pleasures. \Nat:hist,li.II.c.II./ *Sunt quasi servitia verarum apum quamobrem imperant iis./* For albeit generally among all creatures the males, as more worthy, doe master the females; yet in these, the females have the preeminence: and, by the Gramarians leave, the Feminine gender is more worthy then the Masculine, *Hæc apes/* then *hic fucus, hæc Nympha/* then *hic Cephen./* But let no nimble tongued Sophisters gather a false conclusion from these true premisses, that they, by the example of these, may arrogat to themselves the like superioritie: for *Ex particulare non est syllogizare,/* & he that made these to command their males, commanded them to be commanded. But if they would so fain to have it so, let them first imitate their singular virtues, their continuall industry in gathering, their diligent watchfulnesse in keeping, their temperance, chastitie, cleanlinesse, and discreet œconomie, &c. And then, if they meete with such dull Lubbers as these Drones are; they may with lesse blame borrow a point of the Law, and enjoy their longing. Yet when they have it, let them use poore Skimmington as gently as they may; especially in publike, to hide his shame.  
And this they may note by the way, that albeit the females in this kinde have the Soveraigntie, yet have the males the lowder voice, as it is in other living things, Doves, Owsils, Thrushes, &c. the males being knowne by their sounding and shrill notes from the silent females. Yea the wives themselves wil not suffer that Hen to live, which presumeth to crow as the Cock doth: nature teaching that silence, and soft noise becommeth that Sex. 
\24. *When the Bees leave breeding and beat away their Drones./*/ The Bees breeding or laying of seeds beginneth to cease, in some by *Leo/*, in some not before *Virgo/*. After which time these+ *Amazonian/* Dames, having conceived for the next yeere, begin to wax wearie of their mates, and to like their

roome better then their company. At first not quite forgetting their old familiaritie, they gently give them Tom Drums entertainment: they that will not take that for a warning, but presume to force in againe among them, are more shrewdly handled. You may sometime see a handfull or two before a Hive, which they had killed within: but the greatest part flyeth away, and dieth abroad. 


\25. *The Bees compared to the/* Amazons./
*Amazones bellicosæ erant Scythiæ mulieres, quæ cum viris exultantes in Cappadociæ ora juxta amnem Thermodonta consederunt: ubi viris plerique; per insidias accolarum trucidatis, reliquos qui domi remanserant, ut ipsæ solæ rerum potirentur, interficiunt: & armis sumptis etiam cum contemptu hostium se strenue tuentur, & imperium longe lateque: in Europam & Asiæ partem tandem proferunt. Ne vero genus periret, finitimis tanquam maritis ututntur: quos officio functos abigunt: Atque; quot pariunt virgines fovent, & armis exercent masculos vero duræ enecant: unde eas Aeorpata i. Viricidas appellant Scythæ, ut tradit Herodot.l.4. Prima harum regina Marthesia vel Marpesia dicebatur:quæ plures quidem peperit filias, ut Antiopen, Orithyam, Menalippen, & Hypoliten: è quibus duæ majores natu matri successerunt, cæteræ imperium non sunt adeptæ. Amazonum itaque; regnum apum rempublicam aptissime refert: Marpesia apum reginam quæ plures solet producere fœtus: Antiope & Orithya primores filias, quæ primum & secundum examen educunt, iisque moderantur: Menalippe & Hypolite eas principes quæ aut nequaquam aut nequicquam dominantur. Nam post secundum examen aut in alveis morantes morte mulctantur, *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*7./ aut egressæ fere fame pereunt, *v.c./*8.*n./*4. Utriusq; etiam populi mores non minùs conveniunt: nam & apes fœminæ sunt bellicosæ, quæ non modo Europam & quandam Asiæ partem, ut illæ; sed universa orbis terrarum imperia possident: quæ sui sexus prolem summa itidem cura enutrientes, mares omnes tam viros quam filios cædere solent: ut & ipsæ vere Æorpata dici possint./*

\26. *They rid not their Drones all at once./*/ But because in the same Hive they doe not leave breeding all at once; therefore neither doe they kil their Drones all at once: but at the first taking away onely the superfluous, they suffer as many as they need, to remaine longer: some sometime a while moneth after. 
\27. *When forward stalls begin./*/ The forward stockes, that have cast their last swarme in *Gemini/* or soone after, begin at *Leo/*: \28. *When the backward./*/ yea of those in the beginning of *Gemini/* some somewhat sooner, the backward, that cast not their last swarme much before *Leo/* may stay til the end of the same moneth: but usually about *Virgo,/* or a weeke after, they make a cleane riddance of them.

\29. *When full stockes that have not swarmed./*/ Those stockes that being full have not swarmed at all, because they are rich and feare no want, use to suffer them so long and sometime longer, even to the ende of this month. 
\30. *When those that are overswarmed./*/ Those that have over-swarmed themselves, finding their paucitie and weaknesse, wax desperate and carelesse of their estate: and therefore sometime keepe their Drones till toward the end of *Virgo/*, sometime kill them not at all: but let them alone, untill they die by nature: which is not long after. For few of them can live till *Libra/*, and the youngest not to the end of that moneth. *v./* \*V.n.4./*/ Take heed to such stalls, for they are likely to die.
\31. *Sometime the Bees cast out even the white Cephens./*/ Some are so provident, that, to prevent this trouble and save their Honie, they draw the poore Cephens out of their Cells before they be ripe, or come to their second life. Such you may safely trust.
\32. *Timely ridding of Drones a good signe./*/Those that soonest rid their Drones, are likely to be forwardest the next yeare.
\33. *Sometime they rid their Drones in the Spring./*/ Sometimes the Drones are beaten away in the Spring. For when forward stalls (which in their heat are bold to fly abroad while others dare not wagge) have lost many of their Nymphes in a tempestuous and stormie Spring; they will therefore destroy their Drones also. \34. *And afterward breed new againe./*/ But having formerly conceived by them, they then begin the world anew as after an other Winter. and first breeding Nymphs, in the end they breed Cephens againe. Which if they can compasse before swarming time be past, they wil swarme that yeare; otherwise they wil be fat and full, and excellent good either to keepe or to kill.

\35 *Sometime it is good to helpe the Bees in this work./*/ Because the stockes that have cast often, doe beare with their Drones so long, although there be twise so many as bee needfull for the Bees that are leaft; therefore (to save the Honie which those Wolmores would devoure) it is not amisse to prevent the Bees, and presently after the last swarme to diminish their number, with a Drone pot cloomed to the doore: specially of them you meane to take, or see much opprest with superfluous multitude, *v.c.3.n.43./*
