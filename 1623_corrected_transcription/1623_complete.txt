#THE PREFACE/#  

##*to the Reader./*/##  

{T}He great Naturalist, to expresse the excellency of the nature of Bees, saith thus, *Inter omnia insecta principatus Apibus, & jure præcipua admiratio; solis ex eo genere hominum causa genitis/*. \*Plin.Nat.hist.l.11,ca.5/*/ Of all *insecta/* the Bees are chiefe, and worthily to bee most admired; beeing the only things of that kinde, which are bred for the behoofe of men. The later part of which saying, although the delicate Silk-worme have in some hoter Climates disproved; (for in the colder countries, such as is our Iland of *Britaine/*, I doubt mee shee will never quit cost: and therefore is here to be entertained only of them, that doe more respect their pleasure, than their profit; and doe content themselves with the beholding of their queint worke, not expecting any further recompence for their expence and paines;) yet must shee needs confesse the former, and wheresoever she meet the ingenuous and laborious Bee, yeeld the precendence to her, as to hir Better. For the fruite of the Silk-worme serveth onlie to cover the body; but the fruit of the Bees to nourish and cure it: that is to be applied outwardly, this to be inwardly received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health and necessity. But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bee is so great and wonderfull, so comely for order and [cw: beauty,] 

===

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$

beauty, so excellent for Art and wisdome, and so full of pleasure and profit; that the contemplation thereof may well beseeme an ingenious nature. And therefore (not without cause) are the Bees called the Muses birds: *Apes cum causa Musarum esse dicuntur volucres./* \*Var.l./*3.*c./*15./
The love of which did so ravish *Aristomachus/* and *Philiscus/*, that, as *Plinie/* reporteth,\*Nat hist.l./*II.c.9./ they were pleased to spend most of their time in this pleasing businesse. *Ne quis/* (saith hee) *miretur amore carum captos Aristomachum Solensem duodesexaginta annis nihil aliud egisse; Philiscum vero Thasium in desertis apes colentem/* Agrium *cognomimatum: qui ambo scripsere de his/*. *Aristotle/* thought his *Historia animalium/* unperfect, unlesse he had inserted a Tract of the Nature of Bees: of which hee discourseth more at large, then he doth of any other living creature. *Plinie/* likewise in his *Naturalis historia/* is very copious in this argument. Besides whom, divers other haue written thereof: as *Columella, Varro, Palladius, Averroes/*. Yea the learned & grave Fathers of the Church *S. Ambrose/*, and *Isidore/* have thought it a subject fit for their penns. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later times both in Latine and English.
But the many yeeres experiments & observations, which those great Bee-masters *Aristom./* and *Philiscus/* had leaft in writing to posterity; Time, ah injurious Time, hath buried in oblivion. And for the rest that are extant, they seeme unto me to rely more upon the relation of others, than any certaine knowledge of their owne. Notwithstanding them are scattered in them, specially in *Aristotle/* & *Plinie/*, among many false and frivolous conceits, some true and profitable notes: which being found agreeable to experience, I have here and there in this Treatise, as the matter inspireth, for ornament and authoritie inserted. But the later Writers, imitating the ancient where they thought good, chusing some of their directions and refusing o-

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$

thers doe, for the most part, unluckily light upon the worse: so that being compared, they are no way matchable unto them; whom by the advantage of time they might haue surpassed. Among which *Georgius Pictorius/* a learned Physician deserveth best, as having taken most paines in perusing the ancient Authors, and gathering their matter into his method. Whom one *T. H./* of *London/* translating word for word into English, as well as he could, concealing the Authors name, adventured to publish in his owne name. These and the like when a scholar hath thoroughly read, he thinketh himselfe throughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth abroad to put his reading in practise, every silly woman is ready to deride his learned ignorance. 
Wherefore considering howe greate the vertue and efficacy of the fruite of Bees is, \*V.c./*10.*p./*3./ both for the preserving, and restoring of mans health, I thought it not amisse to spend some by-time for my recreation, in searching out their nature and properties, their helpes and hinderances, that I might know how to doe good unto them, which are so good for us, and what is the due and right ordering of these delightful, profitable, and necessary creatures. And having to my contentment, though to my cost, in some sort obtained my desire, I was incited, even by the rule of charitie, to communicate that to my neighbours and country-men, which I have found so beneficiall to my selfe: so that the Reader may now freely reape the fruit of that, which the Author hath deerely sowen vnto him.
\*De generat.an.l./*3.*c./*10./ The Philosopher intreating of the breeding of Bees, professeth himselfe uncertaine of their sex: and therefore, willing in this uncertaintie to grace so worthy a creature with the worthier title, he every where calleth their governor *βασιλεύς/*, *Rex/*. As many as followed him, searching no farther then he did, were content to say as he said. So that I am in- [cw: forced] 

===

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$

forced (unlesse I wil choose rather to offend in *rebus/* then in *vocibus/*) by their leave and thine (learned Reader) to straine the ordinarie signification of the word *Rex/*, and, in such places, to translate it *Queene/*, sith the males heere beare no sway at all, this being an *Amazonian or feminine kingdome. v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*11./
In distinguishing the times of the yeere, I use the Astronomicall months, as most natural and fitting to my purpose *v/*. \*V.c./*3.*n./*36./ Where note that by the name of each moneth, is commonly understood the first day of the same moneth (namely, wheresovever this preposition *At/*, is set before it) except only where it followeth, *In/*, or *After/*, or otherwise the sense doth plainely shew that it is spoken of the whole Moneth. 
When you have once, for your satisfaction, perused this Booke, you need not afterward seeke farre for anything therein, whereof you doubt: the *Index/* of the Chapters or Contents of the Booke; and of the Marginall notes, or Contents of the Chapters will readily direct you. For example, if you would know the Spleeting of Hives, or the manner of Hiving Bees; looking into the *Index/* of the Chapters, you shall perceive the one to appertaine to the Third, and the other to the Fifth; and running over the Contents of either Chapter, you shall find the first to be the Tenth note, and the other the 53. Then turning to these Marginall Notes in the said Chapters, you have in the Text over against them your desire.
Note also, that whereas you have in the Margin, with these Marginall Notes, certaine References unto other places of the Booke, for further explanation of those places against which they stand; *V./* signifieth *vide/*, or *See, C./* with his number the Chapter, and *N./* with his number the Marginall Note. But if *N./* follow *V./* without *C/*; then doth it note some Note of the same Chapter. [cw: I am]

$*The Preface to the Reader./*/$
 
I am out of doubt that this Booke of *Bees/* will in his Infancie lie hidden in obscuritie, as the Booke of *Tropes/* and *Figures/* did for a while goe unregarded, without friends or acquaintance: But as that did by litle and litle insinuate it selfe into the love and liking of many Schooles, yea of the Vniversitie it selfe, where it hath been both privately and publikely read; (a favour, which this Mother doth seldome afford to hir owne Children, lest haply she should seeme too fond over them:) so this will in time travell into the most remote parts of this great kingdome of Great *Britaine/*, and be entertained of all sorts both learned and unlearned: although the *Muses Birds/* are fittest for the *Muses/*, and the knowledge of their long-hidden secrets was chiefly published for the *Muses/* friends. *Quibus me, quicquid sum, & studia mea dico.

When I had view'd this Common-wealth of *Bees,/*
Observ'd their *Lives/*, their *Art/*, and their Degrees
As; how, beside their painefull *Vulgar ones/*, 
They have their *Prince/*, their *Captaines/*, and their *Drones/*;
How they *Agree/*; how temp'ratly they *Feed/*; 
How curiously they *Build/*; how chastly *Breed/*;
How seriously their *Bus'nesse/* they intend; 
How stoutly they their *Common-good/* defend;

[cw: How]

===

How timely their *Provisions/* are provided; 
How orderly their *Labors/* are divided; 
What *Vertues/* patterns, and what grounds of *Art/*,
What *Pleasures/*, and what *Profits/* they impart: 
When these, with all those other things I minde
Which in this *Booke/*, concerning *Bees/*, I finde:
Me thinkes, there is not halfe that worth in *Mee/*, 
Which I have apprehened in a *Bee/*, 
And that the *Pismere/*, and these *Hony-flies/*, 
Instruct us better to Philosophize, 
Than all those tedious *Volumes/*, which, as yet, 
Are leaft unto us by meere *Humane-wit/*. 
For, whereas those but only *Rules/* doe give; 
These by *Examples/* teach us how to live.
Great *God Almighty!/* in thy pretty *Bee/*, 
Mine Eie (as written in small letters) sees
An *Abstract/* of that Wisdome, Power, and Love,
Which is imprinted on the *Heav'ns/* above
In larger *Volumes/*, for their eies to see,
That in such *little prints/* behold not Thee. 
And in this Workmanship (oh Lord) of thine, 
I pray thy *Wisdome/*, and thy *Power/* divine.
And *Praise/* deserves this *Author/*; who hath chose
So well his Times of Leisure to dispose; 
And in that *Recreation/* to delight,
Which honour *God/*, and *us/* advantage might. 
For, since our humane weaknesse doth require,
That in our serioust *Labours/* we retire; 
(Because unlesse the String be sometime slacke
The strongest Bow will have the feeblest backe)
What *Recreation/* better can befit
Our grave *Divines/*; than (when the *Holy writ/*
Is laid aside) in *Gods/* great booke of *Creatures/*
To reade his *Wisdome/*, and their usefull *Natures?/*
Thus doth our *Author/*. And, not only thus; 
But, like his *Bees/* makes hony too for us. 
And is contended that, to helpe us thrive, 
We should partake the profit of his *Hive./*

For which (*my share/*) I thanke him: and for those

#THE FEMININE MONARCHIE,/# ##OR The Historie of BEES./##

##CHAP. I. *Of the Nature and properties of Bees, and of their Queene./*/##

{A}Mong all the Creatures which our bountifull God hath made for the use and service of man, in respect of great profit with smal cost, of their ubiquitie or being in all Countries, and of their continuall labour and comly order, the Bees are most to be admired. 
\1. *Bees yeelde great profit with small cost/*/ For first with the provision of a Hive and some little care and attendance, which need be no hindrance to other businesse, but rather a delightfull recreation amid the same; they bring in store of sweet delicates, most holesome both for meat and medicine, *Fructus apum ab omnibus desideratur, & quæritur: nec pro personarum diversitate discernitur, sed indiscreta sui gratia regibus pariter ac mediocribus æquali suavitate dulcescit: nec solùm voluptati, sed etiam saluti est./* \Ambrosius Hexamer. l.5.cap.21./ And an other saith, *Mille ad usus vitæ laborem tolerant & opera conficiunt/* \Pli nat.hist.l.11.c.5/: as they well know, who know the rare vertues of Honie and Waxe: a taste whereof I will give you in the last chapter. [cw: Secondly,]

===

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees,/*/$

\2. *Every Country fit for Bees./*/ Secondly whereas *non omnis fert omnia tellus,/* some Countrey yeeldeth one fruit, some an other; some beareth one graine, some an other; some breedeth one kinde of Cattle, some an other; there is no ground (of what nature soever it be, whether it be hot or cold, wet or dry, hill or dale, woodland or champian, meddow, pasture, or arable: in a word, whether it be battle or barren) which yeeldeth not matter for the Bee to worke upon. 
\3. *Bees abhorre idlenesse./*/ And thirdly, in their labour and order at home and abroad they are so admirable, that they may be a patterne unto men, both of the one and of the other. For unlesse they be let by weather, weaknesse, or want of matter to worke on, their labour never ceaseth. \Plin.nat.hist.l.11.c.5./ In admiration whereof, one saith,  *Quos efficaciæ industriæque tantæ comparemus nervos? Quas vires? Quos ratione medius fidius viros?/* 
\4. *Bees have a Common-wealth./*/ And for their order, it is such that they may well bee said to have a Common-wealth, since all that they doe is in common, without any private respect. \Nat.hist.li.11.c.5/ *Nihil norunt nisi commune:/* They worke for all, they watch for all, they fight for all. \5. *Their working, watching, fighting, dwelling, dyet, wealth, and young ones are all in common./*/ In their private quarrels, when they are from the Hive or common treasury, howsoever you use them, they will not resist, if by any meanes they can get away. *Cum ruri sint, nec sibi invicem, nec ullis alijs nocent; at verò apud suos alveos pugnant acerrimè/*. Their dwelling and dyet are common to all alike: they have like common care both of their wealth and young ones. \Arist.hist.anim.lib.9.cap.40./ 
\Ambr.Hex.lib.5.ca.21.& Basil.Hexam.Homil.8./ *Solæ in omni genere animantium communem omnibus sobolem habent, unam omnes incolunt mansionem, unius patriæ clauduntur limine, in commune omnibus labor, communis cibus, communis operatio, communis usus, & fructus est./* 
\6. *Bees alwaies loyall to their Soveraigne./*/ And all this under the government of one Monarch, of whom above all things they have a principall care and respect, loving, reverencing, and obeying her *v:/* in all things. 
\*V. Præfat./* Virg. Georg. *V.c.7.n.27.&/*42./ 
*Præterea regem non sic Ægyptus & ingens
Lydia, nec populi Parthorum aut Medus Hydaspes 
Observant: rege incolumi mens omnibus una est:
Amisso rupere fidem; contructaque una est:
Diripuere ipsæ, & crates solvere favorum
Ille operum custos, illum admirantur: & omnes
[cw: *Circumstant/*]

Circumstant fremitu denso, stipantque, frequentes,
Et sæpe attollunt humeris, & corpora bello
Objectant, pulchramque, petunt per vulnera mortem./*
If she goe forth to solace her selfe, (as sometime she will) many of them attend her, guarding hir person before and behinde; they which come forth before her, ever now and then returning, and looking backe, and making withall an extraordinarie noise, as if they spake the language of the Knight Marshals men, and so away they flye together, and anone in like manner they attend her back againe. This I may say, because I have seene it: although the Philosopher be of another minde: *Reges/*, saith he, *nunquam foris visuntur, nisi cum migratur./* \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40./ If by hir voyce she bid them goe, they swarme; if being abroad she dislike the weather, or lighting-place, they quickly returne home againe: while she cheereth them to battaile they fight, *v:/*, \*Vid.c.7.n./*35./ while she is well, they are cheerefull about their worke; if she droope and dye, they will never after enjoy their home, but either languish there till they bee dead too, or yeelding the Robbers, *v:/* \*V.c.7.n./*27./ fly away with them *v:/* \*V.c.7.n./*42./ *Rege mortuo mœret plebs ignava, non cibos convehit, non procedit, tristi tantùm murmure glomeratur circa corpus ejus./* 
\Nat.hist.li.11.c.17./ 
\7. *Bees endure no government, but a Monarchie./*/But if they have many Princes, as when two flye away with one swarme, or when two swarmes are hived together; they will not be quiet till one of them be cassiered: which somtime they bring downe that evening to the mantle, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*46.*&/*47./ where you may finde her covered with a little heape of Bees: otherwise the next day they carie her forth either dead or deadly wounded. Concerning which matter, I will here relate one memorable experiment. Two swarmes being put together, the Bees on both sides, as their manner is, made a murmuring noise, as being discontented with the suddain congresse of Strangers: but knowing wel that the more the merrier, the safer, the warmer, yea, and the better provided; they were quickly made friends. And having agreed which Queene should reigne, and which should die, three or foure Bees brought one of them downe betweene them, pulling and haling her as if they were leading her to execution: which I by chance perceiving, got hold of her by the wings, and with much adoe 
[cw: tooke]

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees,/*/$

tooke her from them. After a while (to see what would come of it) I put her into the Hive againe: no sooner was she among them, but the tumult began afresh, greater then before, and presently they fell together by the eares, fiercely fighting and killing one another, for the space of more than an houre together: and by no meanes would cease, untill the poore condemned Queene was brought forth slaine and laid before the doore. Which done, the strife presently ended, and the Bees agreed well together. 

Somtime when one swarme is put to another, though they do not fight, yet will they not agree of their choice in two or three daies, keeping their Queenes close on both sides. But then all this while they never be at quiet day nor night, nor once offer to work, untill one of them being deposed, they be united in the other. *Vide plura super hac re c.5.n./*74.75.76.
Likewise if the old Queene bring forth many Princes (as she may have six or seven, yea sometime halfe a score or more, which superfluitie nature affoordeth for more suretie, in case some miscarrie) then, lest the multitude of Rulers should distract the unstable Commons into factions, within two daies after the last swarme, yea sometime (when unkinde weather keepeth him in over long) even before he come forth, you shall finde the superfluous Princes dead before the Hive: I have taken eight of them up together brought out of one hive, when two were alreadie gone forth with their swarmes. For the Bees abhorre as well Polyarchie, as Anarchie, God having shewed in them unto men, an expresse patterne of A PERFECT MONARCHIE, THE MOST NATURAL AND ABSOLUTE FORME OF GOVERNMENT. [Greek script] \Hom.II.a.9./ 
\9. *The description of the Queene-Bee./*/ The Queene is a faire and stately Bee, differing from the vulgar both in shape and colour: hir backe is all over of a brighter browne: hir belly even from the top of hir fangs, to the tip of hir traine, is of a sad yellow, somewhat deeper then the richest gold. Shee is longer than a hony-Bee, by one third part, that is, almost an inch long: she is also bigger than a hony-Bee, but not so bigge as a Drone, although somewhat longer: hir head proportionable, but 
[cw: that]

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

that is more round than the little Bees, by reason hir fanges be shorter: hir tongue not halfe so long as theirs: for whereas they gather with the one Nectar, with the other Ambrosia; *v./* \*V.c.6.n./*17./ shee hath no need to use either, being to be maintained, as other Princes, by the labour of hir subjects; hir wings of the same size with a small Bee, and therefore in respect of hir long body, they seeme very short, resembling rather a cloake than a gowne; for they reach but to the middle of hir traine or nether part: hir legges proportionable, and of the colour of hir belly, but hir two hind-legges more yellow: hir nether part so long, and halfe so long as hir upper part, more picked than a small Bees, having it in foure joynts or partitions, and in each joynt a golden barre, in stead of those three whitish rings which other Bees have at their three partitions. The speere she hath is but little, and not halfe so long as the other Bees: which, like a Kings sword, is borne rather for shewe and authority, than for any other use. For it belongeth to hir subjects as well to fight for her, as to provide for her. \Nat.hist.l.11.cap.17./ *Plinie/* writeth thus doubtingly of it: *Non constat inter authores Rex nullumne solus habeat aculeum, majestate tantum armatus, an dederit eum quidem natura, sed usum ejus illi tantùm negaverit: illud constat imperatorem aculeo non uti./* 
But *Aristotle/* doth truly approve the later opinion, as certaine: \Hist.an.l.5.cap.21./ *Reges aculeos habent, sed non utuntur. Quocirca carere eos aculeis nonnulli existimant./*  *Plinie/* describeth them thus, \Nat.hist.l.11.c.16./ *Omnibus forma semper egregia, & duplo quam cæteris major, pennæ breviores, crura recta, ingressus celsior, in fronte macula quodam diademate candicans: Multum etiam nitore a vulgo differunt./* If you desire to see this stately Prince, read *cap./*5.*n./*.34. The breeding of her you may see *c/*.4.*n/*.18. 
\10. *Bees have also inferior Governors or Captaines./*/ Besides their Soveraigne, the Bees have also subordinate Governours and Leaders, not unfitly resembling Captaines and Coronels of Souldiors: \11. *Which are knowne by peculiar markes./*/
For difference from the rest they beare for their crest a tuft or toffell, in some coloured yellow, in some murrey, in manner of a plume; whereof some turne downeward like an Ostrich-feather, others stand upright like a Hearn-top. And of both sorts some are greater

and some lesse, as if there were degrees of those dignities among them. In all other respects they are like to the vulgar. These I think are they that *Plinie/* meaneth, where he saith, *Circa regem satellites quidam, lictoresque, assiduæ custodes authoritatis./* \Nat.hist.li.11.c.17./ In lesse than a quarter of an houre you may see three or foure of them come forth of a good stall; but chiefly in *Gemini,/* before their continuall labour have worne these ornaments. So that he might well say \Plin.Nat.hist.li.11.c.5./ *Rempublicam habent, consilia, ac duces./* All which hee that seriously considereth, must with admiration acknowledge that singular wisedome, order, and government in them, which in no other creature, man onely excepted (if yet to be excepted) is to be found: whence some have inferred a farther matter, 
\Vir.Geor.4/ 
*His equidem signis atque hæc exempla sequuti, 
Esse apibus partem divinæ mentis, & haustus 
Æthereos dixêre--/* 
\12. *Two sorts of Bees./*/\Hist.l.5.c.22./ *Aristotle/* maketh two sorts of Bees, the one (which is best) short, divers coloured, and round; the other long, like unto waspes. *Optimum genus apum quæ breves, variæ, & in rotunditatem compactiles; secundæ quæ longæ & vespis similes./* And in an other place he putteth a difference betweene wilde and tame: saying, *Differunt inter se apes parentibus natæ urbanis, & quæ rustico montanoque victu educatis prodierint: sunt enim hæ sylvestres horridiores aspectu, & iracundiores, & minores; sed opere & labore præstantiores./* \Hist.l.9.c.40./ Whom *Plinie/* followeth almost *verbatim:/* saying *Apes sunt etiam rustica sylvestresque, horridæ aspectu, multo iracundiores; sed opere ac labore præstantiores. Urbanarum duo genera: optimæ breves, variæ, & in rotunditatem compactiles; deteriores longæ, & quibus similitudo vesparum, etiamnum deterrimæ ex ijs pilosæ./* \Nat.hist.li.11.c.18./
But these differences my experience hath not found: neither doe I see how they can be; seeing the swarmes of tame Bees doe often flie into trees, and so become wilde; and the swarmes of wilde Bees are not seldome found, and put into hives. Indeed the wilde are more angry then the tame: but that is because they are lesse used to the company of men. Moreover, there is some difference in the bignesse of Bees: For they that are loaded seeme greater and longer then those

\13. *The parts of a Bee./*/The severall parts of a Bee have their severall uses. 
\14. *Hir hornes./*/ Hir hornes growing in the middle of hir forehead, with two joynts, one close to the head, the other towards the middle, so that she can put them forth at full length when shee will, and drawe them in againe close to hir head; are the proper *organum/* of the sense of feeling; by which, with the least touch, the Bee sodainely senteth any tangible object: and therefore they serve to give warning in the darke, and when she is busie, of any obvious thing quicke or dead that might offend her. 
\15. *Hir eyes./*/ Hir two cheekes being transparent, like Lanthorne, doe serve, though immoveable, in stead of Eyes: through which the species of things visible are conveied to the common Sense. 
\16. *Hir fangs./*/ For gathering hir provision, shee hath two instruments, hir fangs and hir tongue: hir fangs in fashion of a paire of pincers hang not, as the jawes of other things, one over an other, but side-way one against the other, as is most convenient for hir uses. 
\17. *Hir tongue, with the parts of it./*/ Hir tongue is of that length, that hir mouth cannot hold it: but being doubled between hir fangs under hir chinne, it reacheth to the necke. It is divided into three parts: whereof the two outmost serve as a case to cover the third, which being the chiefe, the Bee in hir worke putteth forth beyond the other, and draweth in againe as shee will. And this third part is likewise parted into three, so that there are five in all. 
\18. *Her foure wings./*/ To set these instruments on worke, Nature hath furnished her with 4. wings, which swifter then the East-winde, carry her into all the foure coasts of the world, and thence

\19. *Hir feete./*/ Hir rough and dew-clawed feet apt to take hold at the first touch are in number sixe, that shee may stand fast upon foure, while she useth the other two to wipe her eyes, hir wings, hir tongue, or any other part, and to convay the gathering of hir fanges to hir thighes. \*v.c./*6.*n./*18./ 
\20. *Hir two weapons/*/ For hir defence she is doubly weaponed. \21. *Hir fangs commonly used against insecta./*/ Hir fanges she useth when she is not much angry, against al *insecta/*, as other Bees, Drones, Waspes, &c. therewith pinching and holding them commonly by the legs or wings, and some time by the hornes: but this is rather a chiding, than a fighting, and a warning, rather than a punishment; though withall sometime she bend her speere against them, as if shee would kill and slay. 
\22. *Hir speere sometime./*/ Hir speere she is very loth to use, if by any other meanes she can shift hir enemy, as knowing how dangerous it is to hir selfe: for if she chance therewith to strike any hard part, as the brest or shoulder, shee is enforced to leave hir speere behinde her, and so she killeth and is killed *v./* \*V.n./*31./ with the same stroke.

\24. *The speares commonly used against other creatures./*/ But their speares or stings they use chiefly against things of other sort, as men, beasts, and fowles, which have outwardly some offensive excrement, as haire or feathers, the touch wherof provoketh them to sting: \25. *Haire and feathers cause the Bees to sting./*/ although such stinging be alwaies mortall to themselves (as anone is shewed. *v/*) \*V.n./*31./ For the skinne having received the sting, holdeth it so fast, that when they would be gone, they leave both it and part of their entrals which are fastned to it. *Aculeum apibus natura dedit ventri consertum/*. \Nat.hist.l.11.c.18/ If they light upon Poultry, although their desire bee to the quicke, if they can quickly come at it; yet will they put forth their speares as soone as they touch the feather: and if they chance to hit the hard part thereof, the sting sticketh fast, as in the skinne; and therefore Goose-wings are naught to be used in the hiving of Bees. 
Likewise, if they light upon the haire of your head or beard, (save onely when they come home loaden, or the weather is cold) they will sting, if they can reach the skinne; \26. *Wooll and woollen doe not offend them./*/ although Wooll and Woollen doe not offend them: and if being otherwise angered, they strike their speares in Woollen, they can easily pull them out againe. \27. *Fustian, Leather, and Velvet naught among Bees./*/ But the nap of new Fustian displeaseth them, because it seemeth hairy; and the stuffe is so fast, that it holdeth the sting. Wherefore such apparell is not fit among Bees: as also Leather in Gloves or otherwise, for assone as they touch it they will strike, if they be any whit mooved, and their speares they cannot recover againe. Velvet in facing of hats or else-where, doth anger them as much as any thing, making them strike assoone as they touch it: but it hath not power to hold their speare. \28. *The Bees in their anger aime at the head./*/ When they are angry, their aime is most commonly at the head, and chiefly about the eies, as knowing that there they may do most harme, for that part swelleth most and longest: and yet I never heard that any ever stung the verie eye, as if they were forbidden to touch that tender part.

\29. *When any is stung, the company must be gone./*/ When you are stung, or any in the company, yea though a Bee have striken but your clothes, specially in hot weather, you were best be packing as fast as you can: for the other Bees smelling the rancke savour of the poyson cast out with the sting, will come about you as thicke as haile: so that fitly and lively did he expresse the multitude and fiercenesse of his enemies, that said *They came about me like Bees./* Then is there no way to appease them but flight, the more you resist, the fiercer they are. They are like unto incorrigible shrewes: there is no dealing with them but by patience: though when they sting they are sure to have the worst. \30. *The Bees have the worst when they sting./*/ For the wound endangereth nether life nor limb: two nights sleep will take away the swelling, and two minutes the paine (unlesse it be in verie rheumaticke or humorous bodies: of which sort I have knowne some so swollen and disfigured with that little stroke, that you could scarce knowe them by their favour in five or sixe daies after.) \31. *They lose their sting and entrals, and consequently their lives./*/ But on the other side, whereas the Waspe, Hornet, and Dorre, doe sting often without any hurt to themselves; the Bee never stingeth but once and then shee leaveth hir speere and entrals, more or lesse behinde her, \Virg.Georg.Hist.an.l.9.c.40./ *Animamque in vulnere ponit.(Intereunt quæ percusserint, quoniam sine intestini eruptione aculeus eximi non potest.)/* For within foure and twentie houres after, or, if much of hir entrals come forth with the sting, within halfe that time, she dieth: \32. *The speere of it selfe pierceth deeper when the Bee is gone./*/ But the speere reteining life when the Bee is gone, if it be not presently pulled out, will worke it selfe into the flesh up to the hard end, and so cause the paine and swelling to bee both greater and longer. 
\33. *How to prevent the paine and swelling./*/ Therefore when you are stung, instantly wipe off the Bee, sting and all, and wash the place with your spittle: so shall you prevent both paine and swelling, which otherwise nothing but time can cure: for the poison is so subtill, that it quickly pierceth the flesh, \34. *Nothing but time can cure their stinging./*/ and the wound so little, that no Antidote can follow after: and yet I have heard commended for a remedie the juyce of Houseleeke, of Rue, of Mallowes, of Ivie, of a Marigold

\37. *Safer to walke, then stand among Bees./*/ At any time, when nothing hath angred them, one may boldly walke along by them: but if he stand still before them within the space of a pearch in the heat of the day, it is marvell but one or other spying him from the Hive, will have a cast at him. 
\38. *The fittest time to stirre about Bees./*/ If you have any thing to doe about your hives, the fittest time is in the morning, when the Bees are new gone abroad; and in the evening before they be come in: for then the weather being coole, and the company few at home, they are not so apt to be quarrelling, unlesse they be much provoked. Likewise at other times of the day, when the weather is cold, wet, or windie, they are patient enough.  
\39. *In the heat of the day they are most angry./*/ But about noone in hot weather, and specially when they have tasted of the Hony-dewes, they are soone angrie, and very eager. 
\40. *How to bee armed when the Bees are angrie/*/ But whensoever you have occasion to trouble their presence, or to come among them being troubled, it is better to stand upon your guard, then to trust to their gentlenesse. For the safeguard of your face (which they have most mind unto) provide a purs-hood made of course boultering, to be drawn and knit about your collar: which, for more safetie, is to bee lined against the eminent parts with Woollen-cloth. First, cut a peece about an inch and a halfe broad, and halfe a yard long, to reach round by the temples and fore-head from one eare to the other: which being sowed in his place, joyne unto it two short peeces of the same bredth under the eyes, for the balls of the cheekes: and then for another peece about the bredth of a shilling against the top of the nose. In stead of this, you may use a Cypres Band or a Boulter, having a Handkerchiefe betweene your fore-head and it, to beare it out from the skinne, and your hat on your head to hold it fast. And if they be so earnest that you feare stinging your hands, put on a paire of woollen cuffes or gloves. When you have on this Helmet and Gantlets, as a man armed at all points, you may boldly deale with them, being out of

the danger of their poysoned speares. At other times when they are not angried, a little peece halfe a quarter broad to cover the eyes and parts about them, may serve: for then, though it be in the heat of the day, unlesse they may strike about the eyes, they care not to strike at all.
\41. *Bees dangerous to Cattell./*/ Unto Cattel which have not the reason by flight or otherwise to save themselves they are more dangerous. A Horse in the heat of the day looking over a hedge, on the other side whereof was a stall of Bees, while hee stood nodding with his head, as his manner is, because of the Flies, the Bees fell upon him and killed him. Likewise, I heard of a Teeme that stretching against a hedge, overthrew a stalle on the other side, and so two of the Horses were stung to death. I doubt not but through negligence many such mischances have happened else-where. For this thing hath beene long since observed by that great Philosopher. *Necant/* (saith he) *vel maxima animalia ictu sui aculei: jam equus occisus ab apibus est./* \Arist.hist.an.l.9.c.40./
\42. *The Bees senses./*/ And such are the sorts of Bees, with their integrall parts. Among which, though there do not appear those outward *Organa/* of senting which other *Animals/* have, nor is seene in the head that inward principall+ part, which is the fountaine and seat of all Senses, Phantasie, and Memorie; yet have they the Senses themselves, both outward and inward: which their subtill and active spirits doe excite and quicken, for the works of their curious Art and singular Vertues. *Quamvis non sint membra quæ, velut carina, sensus invehant; esse tamen his auditum, olfactum, gustatum, eximia præterea naturæ dona, solertiam, animum, artem quis facile crediderit. Creat Deus minima corpore acuta sensii animantia: ut majori attentione stupeamus agilitatem muscæ volantis, quam magnitudinem jumenti gradientis./*
\43 *Their sight dim./*/ Of all the five Senses their sight seemeth to be weakest: & weaker when they come home loaded, then when they are leere: and being loaded weaker on foot, then when they are flying. If, when they come home loaded, they light beside the doore, they will goe up and downe seeking for it, as if they were in the darke: and unlesse by chance they hit upon [cw: it,]

it, they must flye againe before they can finde it. As many as fall beside the stoole when it waxeth darke, ten to one they lye abroad all night: yea, if at such time being troubled by any thing they come forth from the stoole, though then they be fresh and lustie, they will leape up and downe, runne and flie to and fro, till they be wearie; but by no meanes can they finde the way in againe. And therefore it is that when they flie abroad, they take such paines at the doore in rubbing and wiping their glazen eies, that they may the better discerne their way forth and backe. 
\44. *Their smelling very quicke./*/ But their smelling is excellent, whereby when they flie aloft in the aire, they will quickly perceive any thing under them that they like, as Honie, Rozin, or Tarre, though it be covered: As soone as the Honie-dew is fallen, they presently winde it, though the Oakes that receive it *v./* \*V.c./*6*.n./*41./ be a farre off: which the Poet, speaking of the excellencie of some creatures in this sense before others, doth thus expresse, 
\Lucret.l.4./ ——*Ideoqe per auras 
Mellis apes, quamvis longè, ducuntur odore./*
And by this sense they finde out any strange Bee, which is not otherwise to be knowne from their owne company, and that in the darke Hive: where, when they are disposed, they will by the same meanes cull out the Drones, yea and pull out the Cephens *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*30./ that are shut up in the cells, not medling with an of their own Sex. 
\45. *Hearing and feeling./*/ Their hearing and feeling are verie quicke. If you touch their Hive but lightly, or the stoole, or the ground neere it; they presentlie perceiving it, make a generall noise: \Hist.an.l.9.cap.40./although *Aristotle/* doubt whether they heare, or not. *Quanquam incertum est an audiant./* But if they did not heare, to what purpose is that musicke made in the Hives, before the swarming? *v.c./*5.*n/*28. and in the battaile, *vid.c./*7.*n./*34. or his tinging of swarmes to make them come downe, *v:/* {manicule} in *c./*5.*n./*37.

And yet I have read of a greater knowledge then all this: How there were Bees so wise and skilfull, as not only to descrie a certaine little God a mightie, though he came among them in likenesse of a Wafer-cake; but also to build him an artificiall Chappell. If I should relate the Storie, all men, I know, would not beleeve it: notwithstanding, because every man may make some use of it, you shall have it. 
\50. *A strange tale concerning the knowledge and devotion of Bees./*/ A certain simple woman having some stals of Bees which yeelded not unto hir desired profit, but did consume and die of the murraine; made her mone to another Woman more simple then hir selfe: who have her counsell to get a consecrated Host, and put it among them. According to whose advice she went to the Priest to receive the Host: which when she had done, she kept it in her mouth, and being come home againe she tooke it out, and put it into one of hir Hives. Whereupon the murraine ceased, and the Honie abounded. The Woman therefore lifting up the Hive at the due time to take out the Honie, saw there (most strange to be seene) a Chappell built by the Bees, with an altar in it, the wals adorned by marvellous skill of Architecture, with windowes conveniently set in their places: also a doore and a steeple with bells. And the Host being laid upon the altar, the Bees making a sweet noise, flew round about it. 
But whether this doe more argue the supernaturall knowledge and skill of the Bees, or the miraculous power of the Host, or the spirituall craftinesse of him, whose comming is by the working of Satan with all power and signes and lying wonders, some scrupulous +Skeptick \+A Gellius, l.11.c.5./ may make a question: and presuming to examin every particular circumstance over narrowly, will make objections against the truth of the Storie: which, by their leaves, in the behalfe of my Author, I must not spare to answer. First, it may be they will object that the Host being held so long in the Womans mouth, could not choose in that space but melt and marre. 
[cw: Indeed,]

===

$*and of their Queene./*/$

Indeed, if it did remaine, as it was, a Wafer-cake, this were likely enough: but being turned into flesh, the case is altered. If they shall say that because it was now Honie-harvest, at which time good stals, such as this was, are full of Wax and Honie, that therefore there could not be roome enough for a Chappell with a steeple and bells in it; I answer, that this is as weake and simple as the former. For seeing it is knowne that a Blacke-smith of *London/* did make a Locke and a Key so little that a flye could draw it; why should not the little Smith of *Nottingham/*, which doth the worke that no man can, frame a little Chappell in a litle roome? But then perhaps they will reply, if wee grant you this, yet how could the Bees flie about the altar in that little Chappell, seeing they are scarce able flie in so narrow a close roome as the emptie hive? As for that, it may be a mistaking of a word: haply the woman said they did but crawle. If they shall aske how the woman could see the altar with the Host standing in the Chancell, and the Bells hanging in the steeple, seeing the waxen walls were not transparent, they maie easily thinke that the Bees would give their dame leave to looke in at the windowes. And if they shall say that those bells being made of such metall would give but a weake sounde, when they were rung to Mattins; they must consider the Parishoners dwelt not farre off. And so I thinke these captious Criticks will hold themselves satisfied. 
Unto this Storie my Author immediately addeth an other, like unto it, and as likely: how certaine Theeves having stollen the Silver Box wherein the Wafer-Gods use to lye, and finding one of them there, being loth, belike, that hee should lye abroad all night, did not cast him away, but laid him under a Hive: whom the Bees acknowledging, advanced to an high roome in the Hive, and there in stead of his silver boxe, made him another of the whitest Waxe: and when they had so done, in worship of him, at set houres they sung most sweetly beyond all measure about it: yea the owner tooke them at it at midnight, with a light and all. Wherewith the Bishop being made acquainted, came thither with many others: and lifting up the Hive he saw there

$*Of the Nature and properties of Bees,/*/$

neere the top a most fine box, wherein the Host was laid, and the Quires of Bees singing about it, and keeping watch in the night, as Monkes do in their Cloisters. The Bishop therefore taking the Host carried it with the greatest honour into the Church: whither many resorting, were cured of innumerable diseases. 
I doubt not, but some incredulous people wil quarrell this Storie as well as the former: making question, since the combs in the top of the Hive, are not past halfe an inch one from an other, how there could be roome for a boxe of that bredth that would containe the Host; and then being there, how it might be seene by the Bishop, seeing those spaces are alwaies filled with Bees, and the Storie saith, that they were then singing about it: and therefore perhaps they will suspect the whole Narration, supposing it rather to be an unadvised device of some idle Monke, which, if he had consulted with them that have skill among Bees, might have made his tale more probable. Alledging moreover, that therefore there is no mention made of my particular person, time, or place, lest the circumstances should disprove the matter it selfe. All which objections I could as easily answer as the former, if I thought it needfull; But now because some may be as ready to mistrust my relation, as others are to object against the truth of the Stories; I will here in mine owne behalfe for their satisfaction, set downe in my Authors owne words.

In which Storie wee may note, besides the wonderfull knowledge and devotion of the Bees, an incredible power and vertue also. For this God which they kept and compassed, is said to have the gift of healing, which others, though of as good a making, we know doe want.

\52. *Justice./*/ Also, in their owne Common-wealth, they are most just, not the least wrong or injurie is offered among them. But indeed I cannot much commend their Justice towards strangers: for all that they can catch is their owne: unlesse they may bee excused in this respect, that the Bees of divers hives are at deadly feud, or rather as Kingdomes, that are at defiance one with another. *v.c./*7.*n./*25.

\55. *The age of Bees./*/ Anent the age of Bees there are divers opinions: some thinke that they may live foure or five yeares, yea some six or seven: \Georg.4.Hist.l.5.c.22./ *Neque enim plus septima ducitur æstas./*

But the truth is, a Bee is but +a yeares Bird, with some advantage.
+Which is a long life in comparison of the Silk-wormes, which live but foure moneths; or of the Waspes, which live but five: or of the Drones, which but six.
\56. *The difference betweene the young Bees and old./*/
For the Bees of the former yeare, which until *Gemini/* in the next yeare doe looke so youthfully, that you cannot discerne them from their full growne Nymphes, which that spring they have bred; doe from thenceforth change with manifest difference: for the young Bees continue great, full, smooth, browne, well-winged; the old waxe little, withered, rough, whitish, ragged-winged: and withall so feeble, that when they come loaded home, if any thing stand in their way, yea many times, though there be nothing, they fall downe, and being loaded cannot rise againe: and then either a little cold or wet in the day, or the nights dew killeth them: you may daily finde, specially in *Cancer/* and *Leo/*, some dead, some halfe-dead before the Hives, and some alive and lustie, which yet can never rise againe. Some of them will holde out so long, till their wings are more than halfe worne: but by *Libra/* you shal scarce see one of them leaft. 
\57. *The office of the young Bees./*/ The young Bees, as best able, beare the greatest burdens: for they not only worke abroad, but also watch and ward at home both early and late: when need is, they hazzard their lives in defence of the rest, they beat away the Drones, and fight with other Bees and Waspes, and assault with their speeres whatsoever else offendeth them, they carrie their dead forth to be buried, and performe all other offices. \58. *And of the old./*/ But the labour of the old ones is onely in gathering, which they wil never give over, while their wings can beare them: and then when they cease to worke, they will cease also to eat: such enemies are they to idlenesse. And therefore generally they die in their delightfull labour, either in the field or comming home: *Atque animas sub fasce dedere./* \Virg./ Sometimes as well in Summer as Winter *v./*\*V.c./*3.*n./*59.*&/*62./ the Bees take pleasure to play abroad before the Hive, specially those that are in good plight, flying in and out, and about, so thicke, \59. *Bees wont efsoones to play./*/

#CHAP. II/#
#*Of the Bee-Garden, and Seats/* for the Hives./#


\1. *Of five things requisite in a Bee-garden, the first is that it be night at hand./*/ 
{F}Or your Bee-garden, first choose some plot nigh your home, that the Bees may be in sight and hearing; because of swarming, fighting, or other suddaine hap, wherein they may neede your present helpe. While the stalls are few, your Garden of Hearbs and Flowers will serve. *Hortis coronamentisque, maxime alvearia & apes conveniunt, res præcipui quæstus compendijque cum favit./* \Nat.hist.li.21.c.12./ But when they are growne to a sufficient number, they require a square greene plot fitted for the purpose. *v.n./*8.
\2. *That it be safely fenced from cattell and winds./*/ 2. See it bee safe, and surely fenced, not onely from all Cattell, (which if they breake in, may quickly spoile both the Bees and themselves) and specially from Swine (which by rubbing against the Hives, and tearing the hackles in a wantonnesse, are most apt to overthrow the stalls;) but also from the violence of the winds: that when the Bees come laden and wearie home, they may settle quietly.*v.n./*5. 
\3. *The North and East fences should be high./*/ The North fence of your Garden should bee close and high, that the cold wind of that coast, (which blowing against the Bees comming home wearie, would throw downe 
[cw: and]

===

$*Of the Bee-Garden,/*/$

and kill many) may bee altogether kept from them. And therefore, if it may be, set your Bees on the South side of your house. 
The East-fence also would bee good and high to keepe from the Bees as well the sunne, as the winde. For the sunne rising doth oftimes till them forth, when the ayre is colder then they can endure; and the East-wind being cold & sharp is very unkinde for Bees, specially in the Spring. 
\4. *The South and West fence must be also good but not so high as to hide the Sunne from the Hives./*/But in no wise let the place be shadowed from the South-sunne: for that doth not onely dry the Hives and relieve the Bees in the Winter and Spring, but also causeth them to swarme in Summer, if it be not extreme hot and drie *v./* \*v.c./*5.*n./*19./
Nor yet from the Sunne-setting: because in calme and pleasant weather the Bees will be in field after the Sunne is downe, even as long as they can there see: and if when they returne, they finde it darke at home, many of them, their sight being but dim, *v/*. \V.c.1.n.43/ fall short or wide: which flying and running to and fro till they be wearie, at length yeeld to the cold dew. 
Otherwise let the fences be as good against the South and West-winds also, as may be: for although they be not so cold and bitter as the other; yet are they no lesse violent, and more frequent: so that they also doe do much harme, specially in the Spring. 
\5. *In rough winds Bees need a skreene./*/ And therefore if at that time of the yeare, in rough and boistrous winds, you finde that the Garden-fences doe not sufficiently guard and defend them; then it is good to set up wixed or lined hurdles, or some other skreene betweene them and the weather. For though they can shift abroad in the strongest winds, as a ship that has sea-roome; yet are they easily overthrowne at the Hive, as a shippe is soone wrecked at the Haven. 
A house or wall is fittest for the North fence: and a Quicke-set-hedge for any of the other three: it may serve also for the first, specially if it be thicke. 
\6. *That it be sweet/*/ 3. That the place be sweet, not annoyed with any stinking savour. I have knowne a stall in the Spring being sufficiently provided of Honie, and having bred young, to forsake all, because of Poultry that roosted in a tree over them.

*Odêre fœdos odores, proculque, fugiunt/*: And yet the smell of urine doth not offend them: nay, they wil bee very busie where it is shed. It is thought they use it for Physike. *Remedium contra alvi concitationem est urina hominum vel boum./*
\7. *Neither very cold in Winter, nor over hot in Summer./*/ 
4 That it be neither verie cold in Winter, nor over hot in Summer. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Locus æstate non fervidus, hyeme tepidus, v:/* \*V./*{manicule}*in c.3.n.36/*/ A bare flower is naught in both seasons: because in Winter it is over cold, and by that meanes quickly chilleth the Bees that light upon it; and in Summer it causeth them to lie forth through excessive heat, *v./* \v.c.5.n.19./ A grassie ground therefore is best at all times: but let it be kept notte in Summer, and not wet in Winter: \8. *A grassie ground is best, kept notte and drie./*/ for long grasse and weeds about the Hive, doe but harbour the Bees enimies, *v./* \*v.c./*7.*n./*3./ and hinder both their passage in and out, and their rising againe when they fall short: and water if it stand, as it will be offensive to your selfe, so is it dangerous to your Bees for chilling and drowning them. And as the parts about the hives are to be kept notte & bare; so are other places also, where the swarmes doe use to play and pitch, whether within or without the Garden, to bee freed likewise from long grasse and weedes, much more from Beanes, Pease, Hempe, and such high things: for the young weake Nymphs falling in those shadie places, except the weather be warme and drie, are in danger to be chilled before they can rise againe. For which cause the swarmes doe usually refuse to stay and settle about such places: and then if windie or cloudie weather suffer them not to goe further, they must either goe home, or light upon some other Hives: where, without your present skill and diligence, they are like to be all lost.
\9. *Beset with trees and bushes./*/ 5 That it be conveninently beset with trees and bushes fit to receive the swarmes, as Plum-trees, Cherry-trees, Apple-trees, Filberds, Hazels, Thornes, &c. Which they will the more delight to light upon, if, convenient boughes hanging out alone from the bodies, the twigs below standing in their way be pruned, and the weeds and grasse underneath be cut away close to the ground. Although, if they be willing to stay, they will not refuse a dead hedge, a Lavender Border, or the like, or sometime the bare ground. For want of trees, 
[cw: some]

===

$*Of the Bee-Garden,/*/$

some have stucke up greene boughes, and the Bees have lighted upon them. 
\10. *Two sorts of seats./*/ The place being thus fitted, the seates are to be provided: which, whether they be stooles or benches, must be set a little shelving, that the raine may neither runne into the hive, nor stay at the dore. 
\11. *The benches not so good as single stooles./*/ To set many stals upon a bench (as many use to do) is not good: for that in Summer it may cause the Bees to fight, as having easie accesse on foot to each other, and standing so neere that they shall sometime mistake the next Hive for their owne: and in Winter the bench wil bee alwaies wet, which looseth the cloome, rotteth the bottome of the Hive, and offendeth the Bees: and the Mouse *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*2./ at all times hath free passage from one to an other, without feare.
\12. *Swarmes may be set on benches./*/ The single stooles therefore are best. And yet it is not amisse to set most of your swarmes upon benches, about the old stalls: from whence remove them to the stooles, when the stalls are taken: and then set up the benches till an other yeare. Yet I preferre single stooles set two foot apart, though they bee laid flat on the ground: but it is better to reare then with foure legges, though little and short. If they be twelve or thirteene inches, three or foure inches may bee forced into the ground for their surer standing. 
\13. *Woodden stooles better than they of stone./*/ The best stooles are of wood: those of stone are too hot in hot weather, and (which is worse) too cold in cold. 
\14. *The size of stooles./*/ For their size, they should not be above halfe an inch or an inch without the Hive: save onely before, where there needeth the space of three or foure inches, that the Bees may have roome enough to light upon: specially then, when the sight of a rainy cloud sendeth them thronging home. Which fore-part from one side to the other, is to be cut shelving that it may the better avoid the raine. And therfore if the Hive be fifteene inches over, the stoole shoulde not be above sixteene or seventeen inches one way, and nineteene or twentie at the most the other way. 
\15. *Which way the stooles should be set./*/ These stooles would be set toward the South, or rather a point or two into the West: that the Hive may somewhat 
[cw: breake]

===

$*and Seats for the Hives./*/$

breake the East-winde from the doore, *v./* \*V.not./*3./ and that the doore may be lightened by the Sunne-setting when they returne late and loaded from field, *v./* \*V.not./*4./ and therefore it is to be wished that the Garden-fences did stand accordingly.
\16. *How neere to each other./*/ They should stand in straight rankes or rewes from East to West, five foot one from another (measuring from doore to doore) and from North to South, six foot one before an other.
\17. *How neere to the fences./*/ Likewise let them stand as farre from three of the fences, as they doe one from an other. And for a plot of fiftie foot square, will receive seven rankes of nine stooles a peece, with the space of eight foot before them: which if it were bigger, were so much the better. 
For want of roome or stooles, or wit, many doe set their stalls neerer together. But the greater distance is much better: not onely that you may have roome enough to goe round about every one, to see and mend what is amisse; but also that the Bees, when they come home in haste, specially when a swarme goeth backe againe, may be sure to flie into their own Hive. For if they stand neere together, at such time many will take the next Hive for their owne, and then they fall together by the eares; *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*79./and the Nymphs, when they go first abroad, wil by that occasion the sooner mistake: which if they doe, they dye. 
The manner of placing the stooles in your Garden, with the distance of the rankes, I have here expressed.

\18. *Annus climactericus./*/ This Climactericall number of nine times seven, is a competent or rather complete store for any one Garden, though large and alone: which being well ordered, will yeeld the Bee-master the better part of a liberall maintenance: if any be so happy to attaine unto it. So that I see no evill at all in this Number: although the sixtie three yeare of mans age being likewise called *Climactericall/*, (because it ariseth of nine Septenaries, as so many Climacters or Ladder-rounds) be counted of some, and those no small fooles too, a parles and ominous time: more dangerous for death, then all the

other yeares of their life+. For which conceipt if you see no reason; thinke it is grounded upon good observations: for this is certaine, that a ladder of nine rounds hath beene fatall unto many. 
+Ptolomæus *obliquè eos notat, qui climactericus annos faciunt ex numerorum sola observatione, ut enneadicos & hebdomaticos. Unde multis molesta senibus superstitio super anno sexagesimo tertio, quoniam pejus angui tigrideque formidant: sed peccat in his vulgus errore veniali, qui Philosophi esse volunt, quis excusaverit?/* Pic.Miran.Lib.6.c.19.
\19. *The Bees Register./*/ Answerable unto this climactericall squadron it is meet you have at hand a *Register/*, containing the severall ages and yearely increases of all your stalls.Whereby you may be directed every yeare, which are to be taken and which to be kept for store: *v:/* which is the chiefe point of a thriving Bee-master. This Register may bee a *Synopsis/* or Table drawne upon a sheet, or half sheet of Paper, divided into sixtie three squares, or as many as be needfull for the stalls in your Garden: having first the foure Coasts, *E.S.W./*and *N./* noted in the out-sides: secondly, the middle rew of squares from *S/* to *N./* distinguished by Letters, the first square being marked above with D, the second with C, and the third with B, which are Southerne: The fourth (being the chiefe and middle-most, unto which all the squares in the Table have reference) with A, the fift with B, the sixth with C, the seventh with D, which last three are Northerne: and thirdly, the first rew of squares next the Letters on both the *E/* and *W/* side, noted in the top or South-part with one I, the second on both sides with II, the third with III, and the fourth with IV. 
The Table thus drawne, when you have set a swarme upon any stoole in the garden, marke in what letters ranke it is, what number from the Letter, and whether Eastward or Westward: and in the square answering thereto begin his Register, setting downe first the two last figures of the yeare of the Lord, then for a prime swarme, a double circle, for a castling halfe a double circle, then the day of the moneth in which he was swarmed, writing M for May, J for June, *J/* for July. The next line begin with the next yeare: if he did

$*Of the Bee-Garden./*/$

swarme, set downe a crossed circle, and the day of the moneth: if he swarmed againe, set downe in the same line a halfe circle, with a down-right stroke, and the day of the moneth: if he did not swarme, but were full to the doore, set downe a circle with a full point in it: if he did also lye out, set downe a circle with a blotted circle in it: if hee did neither lie out nor were full, set downe a void circle. 

{diagram}
And then doe likewise all the yeares that this stall endureth. 
When the Table waxeth full; after the vindemie make a new: taking out of the old the Register of those that live. By this meanes you may certainly know the age, and yearely increases of any stall in your Garden: and so guesse whether he be fitter to kill or to keepe. *V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*3.
\20.*The stooles height/*/ Also the stooles should not stand above two foot from the ground, because of the wind: nor under one foot for the dampnesse of the ground in winter, which would make the Hives moist and mustie; and for the heat of the ground in Summer, which in hot and dry weather would make the Bees lye out, and so hinder both their worke and swarming, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*19./
The best heighth is between eighteene and twentie inches. Yet if you have many, it is convenient that the more Northward rankes should stand higher, and the more South-ward lower, descending by degrees from two foot to one: as if there be two rewes of stooles, let the first stand two foot from ground, the next eighteene inches, & the benches or swarme-stooles one foot or lesse. *v./* \*V.n./*12/ If there be three rankes beside the benches, let the second be twentie inches, and the third sixteene, &c. 
This unequall heighth of rankes may as conveniently be effected, though the stooles be all equall, by the unequall levelling of the ground: which in a great Bee-fold is best. 
\21. *How to be footed./*/ The stone-stooles must be footed as they may: the fashion of each place where they are used will direct you. But the plankes or woodden stooles are either to have foure feet made of the heart of Oake, or of some other lasting Wood; [cw: or]

===

or to be fastned to one foot with two woodden pins: which foot let be made of sound timber five or six inches over; and of that length, that it may be set betweene fifteene and eighteene inches in the ground.

##CHAP. III./##
#*Of the Hives, and the Dressing/* of them./#

\1. *Two sorts of Hives./*/ {I}N some countries they use strawn Hives bound with briar: in some wicker Hives made of Privet, Withy, or Hazell, dawbed usually with Cow-cloome tempered with gravelly dust, or sand, or ashes.
\2. *Strawne Hives with their inconveniencies and remedies./*/ The strawne Hives when they are olde and loded, do usually sinke on the one side, (specially if they take wet) and so break the combes and let out the hony: for which cause first see that they be hard wrought, and then spleet them strong with a Cop, *v./* \*V.n./*11./ fitted to the top of the Hive.  
\3. *Wicker-Hives with their inconveninecies and remedies./*/ The Wicker Hives will still be at fault, and lie open, (if they be not often repaired) unto Waspes, Robbers, & Mise. Any of these, if shee finde but a little chap, will dig her way in: and the Mouse (unlesse the twigs bee close wrought) though she finde none. 
Both these Hives, if they be not well covered, are subject to wet: which maketh them musty, and, if it be much, rotteth the combes and destroyeth the Bees. But the heat in Summer, the cold in Winter, and the raine at all times doth soonest pierc the Wicker Hives: for which cause it is good to double-dawbe them.
\4 *Strawne Hives best./*/ All things considered, the strawne Hives are better, specially for small swarmes.
[cw: The]

===

$*Of the Hives, and the Dressing of them./*/$
\5.* The fashion of Hives./*/The Bees do best defend themselves from cold, when they hang round together in manner of a Sphære or Globe (which the Philosophers account the most perfect figure) and therefore the neerer the Hive commeth to the fashion thereof, the warmer and safer be the Bees. But of necessitie the bottome must be broad, for the upright and sure standing of the Hive, and for the better taking out of the combs: and the top must rise some two or three inches higher then the just forme of a Globe, to stay the hackle, and to shunne the raine: which yet, where the Hives are covered with panns, is not necessary. Otherwise let your Hives vary no more from this round figure, then needs must: as where it is within from the top to the skirts seventeene inches, in the middle or widest place through the center fifteene inches, and at the skirts thirteene, after this forme. 
{diagram}
This forme with his dimensions wil conteine three pecks: and the abating of one inch in each dimension, abateth a gawne in the content. 
The best that I have seene are wrought by *Thomas May/* of *Sunning,/* about one mile from *Redding./*

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

\6. *The size of Hives./*/ Hives are to be made of any size betweene a bushell and halfe a bushell: that any swarme, of what quantity or time soever, may be fitly hived, *v/*: \*V.c./*5.*n./*43./ Lesse then halfe a bushell will not containe a competent stall; and more then a bushell is found too bigge for any company to continue, and thrive together. 
The midling size of three pecks, or within a pottle, under or over, as fitly conteining the naturall quantity of a good stall, is most profitable. 
Have alwaies Hives enough of all sorts (but most of the midling size) in store, lest they be to seeke when you should use them.
\7. *When Hives are to be made and provided./*/ The best time for making them, whether they be Strawne or Wicker, is in the three still moneths of Winter, *Saggittar. Capr./*and *Aquar. v:/*  \*V.n./*54./ for then the +straw, briers, and twigs are best in season: and then it is best to provide them, because then they are best cheape.
+The best straw is most yellow without blacke spots, which is strong and tough.  
\8. *How Hives are to be fed before they receive the swarmes./*/ Your Hive being ready is thus to be dressed. First, take away all those staring strawes, twigs, and other offensive jagges that are fast in the Hive, making the in-side as smooth as may be: for these obstacles being many, if they cause not the Bees to forsake the Hive, yet will they much trouble and hinder them: you may heare them (specially in the night) scraping and gnawing three or foure daies after they be hived, yea sometime a weeke together, as though there were mise in the Hive: and in strawne Hives a long time after. 
\9. *The pruning of Hives./*/ If you need but few Hives you may prune them cleane with your knife: if you must use many, then, having wet the skirts with a cloth, singe or sweale the in-side: but first and last rub it well with a Rubber, which is a peece of rough grind-stone or sand-stone, as great as your hand can hold.
\10. *The spraying or spleeting of them./*/ 2. The Hive being pruned, put Spleetes in it, three or foure, as the largenesse of the Hive shall require: the upper ends whereof set together at the top of the Hive, and the nether ends fasten below in equall distance, about a handfull 
[cw: above]

===

$*Of the Hives,/*/$

above the skirt. In a wicker Hive let the upper ends rest against the middle of the staffe, & the nether ends against the parts of it betweene the Wickers; and in a strawne Hive, set the upper ends together in a Cop, and the nether ends against the briars or threads, between the third & fourth roule.
\11. *The making of the Cop, and of the Spleets./*/The Coppe is a round peece of wood an inch or two thicke, whose lower *superficies/* is flat, with a hole in the middle halfe an inch deepe, for the spleets to rest in; and the upper is convex, turned or hewed fit to the concavitie of the top of the Hive. 
And for the Spleets, take a streight hazel or willow-sticke, quarter it if it be bigge enough, else slit it: then shave and smooth the clefts, and having brought them to a convenient (b) strength & length, cut the lower ends forked, to stay against the Hives sides, and the upper ends somwhat picked, and of that bignesse that they may fitly joyne in the Cop or middle of the staffe, with their backs leaning (a) hard and fast against one another.  
(a) If the Hive conteine above three peckes, it may well receive foure Spleets: otherwise three will suffice. 
(b) Stiffe enough to keepe up the Strawne Hives from sinking, specially when they are turned. *v.c./*5.*n./*22.*&/*23.
(c) If you put foure Spleets in a Hive, then cut their backes, where they must leane one against another, to square angles, such as be foure in a circle: if but three, cut them to obtuse angles, such as are three in a circle: (you may readily try them, before you put them in, by Moulds made just of those formes) and so will they stand close and firme together. The first two of three, and the first three of foure are loose: it is the last that makes all fast.
And this is a handsome, easie, and sure way of spleeting: it is also good for drawing the Combes without breaking, and for keeping the Hive from sinking and from tearing at the top. Besides which there are divers sorts of spleeting, needlesse to be rehearsed: for every Countrey hath his fashion.
\12. *The seasoning of them./*/ 3 Lastly, in swarming time season the Hives that you meane to use, rubbing them with sweet herbes such as the Bees love, as Tyme, Savourie, Marjoram, Baulme, Fenell, Hysop, Mallowes, Beane-tops,&c. And when the swarme 
[cw: is]

===

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

is setled, take the Hive that you thinke fit for it in bignesse, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*43./ and with a branch of Hazell, Oake, Willow, or any of the foresaid herbs, but chiefly with a sprig of that tree whereon the swarme lighted, wipe the Hive cleane; and then dipping it into Meth, or faire water mixed with a little hony, or with milke and salt, or for a need with salt only, besprinkle the same.
\13. *The seasoning of an old Hive./*/ But if the Hive have beene used before, after you have pared away the wax as cleane as may be, if you thinke the former dressing will not make it sweet enough; then let a hogge eate two or three handfuls of mault, or pease, or other corne in the Hive: meane while doe you so turne the Hive, that the fome or froth, which the hogge maketh in eating, may goe all about the Hive. And then wipe the Hive lightlie with a linnen cloth, and so will the Bees like this Hive better than a new. But besprinkle it also, when you doe use it, as is shewed before. And so serve a new Hive when the Bees are so froward, that they will not otherwise abide. 
\14. *How Hives are to be ordered when the Bees are in them./*/ And thus are the Hives to be prepared and Dressed, before they receive the Bees. Now will I shew you how they are afterward to be fitted and furnished.
\15. *The Hives alwaies well hackled./*/ 1. First, let them be alwaies be well covered, that they may be safe in Summer from heat, lest, the wax melting, the Combes fall downe; *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*53./ in Winter from cold, lest it kill the Bees; *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*54./ and at all times from raine, lest it corrupt first the Hive, afterward the Combes, and at last the Bees also.*v./* \*V.c./*7.*.n/*58./ In some places (where the stalls are not many) they use earthen covers: but these doe not defend the lower part, and in Summer are too hot. \Nat.hist.li.21.c.14./
\16. *How to make a hackle./*/ The best cover for Hives is a thicke hackle: *Alvearia stramento operiri utilissimum./* Which is thus to be made. Take foure or five handfulls of +\+ *In want of such straw, Wood-benet, or Sedge, or Rushes may serve./*/ Wheat or Rie leased out of the sheafe: which being bound up severally, beat out the corne; and then casting away their bands, draw out the eares of each handfull longer on the one side than on the other: and putting the long sides together (so to make the Head in forme of a Pyramis or Suger-loafe, for shooting the raine) [cw: binde]

===

$*Of the Hives,/*/$

binde them all in one under the eares, as hard as you can. 
\17. *The Cap of two sorts./*/ The Head is to be covered or bound fast with a Cap: of which there be two good fashions, the one wreathed, the other platted.
\18. *The wreathed Cap./*/ The wreathed Cap is thus made; having bound the bundles all fast together with a thong, cord, or other strong string, lease out the sheafe almost a handfull of the strongest straw, and lay it in soake about a quarter of an houre. Being thus prepared, take out of that wet bundle a litche of 40. or 50. reedes or strawes; and laying halfe of them one way, and halfe the other, that the band may be of equall bignesse, take them up together; and then mingling one end of the litche with the middle reeds of the Head, and twisting them fast together in your hand, let the band harle or double in the very top of the Head: and so begin to binde the Head round, working downeward, and still twisting the band as you goe. When that litche is well-nigh wrought up, take out of the wet bundle so many more reedes prepared as before: and when you have mingled one end thereof with the end of the first litche, holding them in your hand twist them fast together: and so continue your worke, alwaies binding as hard as you can, & bearing up every roule close to his fellow. When you are come down to the string, loose it, and binde the last or lowest roule in the place thereof, making fast the end, by forcing it up between the Head and the Cap with a forked sticke and a mallet.  
\19. *The platted Cap./*/ The platted Cap is wrought contrary to the wreathed: for whereas that is begun in the crown, & wrought downward toward the right hand, and is made fast in the necke; this is begun at the necke, and wrought upward toward the left hand, and is made fast in the crowne, after this manner.
First take a litch of strong reedes, and having wetted and wound it a little, put it about the neck of the hackle, and knitting the ends in a half knot, girt the hackle hard with it: (your assistant holding one end, while you pull the other) then to make this collar fast, wrap each end about it, forcing them betweene the collar and the head with the forke and mallet: Otherwise you may make a strong collar of a small 
[cw: With.]

===

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

With. The collar thus fitted to the necke, set the hackle betweene your legs, as you sit or stand, with the knot outward: and then, to begin, take up a litche of the eares (about the bignesse of the of the top of your finger) next unto the fore-said left end of the collar, and laying this end betweene it and the head, turne the top of the end downeward, and so leave it: then take the next litch, and laying the first betweene it and the head, turne the first downeward, and so leave it: then likewise take a third litche, and laying the second betweene it and the head, turne the second downeward, and so leave it: likewise the fourth, and so forth, working thus round, till you come to the crowne, and platting still the litches hard, and close to the head.  But when you come to the other end of the Collar, take that in for a litche. If the litches be too short for the worke, plucke them up higher about the necke as you goe. When you have wrought up to the Crowne, knitting the foure last top-litches in a true-loves-knot, make all fast. 
\20. *The bignesse of the hackle./*/ The hackle thus made of foure or five handfulls will conteine in compasse about the necke, close under the Cap, betweene sixteene and twenty inches: sixteene will serve for the smaller Hives, and twenty for the greatest, although they be five feet about. 
\21. *The length of it./*/ For the length of the hackles, each one is to be fitted to his Hive, so that the skirts thereof may reach to the stoole, or within halfe an inch of it round about; save onely before, where it must be pared somewhat shorter, that the Bees passage be not hindered. 
\22. *The belt or garth./*/ And then with a small pliant Garth or Belt of Bethwyn, Bramble, Brier, or the like, gird the hackle close to the Hive+, least the wind disorder it. If there be any crooke or bout in the Belt, set that before, that the hackle, bearing in that place farther out, may shoot the water from the doore: otherwise, for that purpose, set the Belt somewhat higher before, then behinde.
+ In the Winter, place the Belt below the middle or biggest part of the Hive, to keepe it warme in extremity of cold. In Summer above, that the nether part of the hackle hanging out from the Hive, the Hive may be the cooler: and then because the Belt will be apt to rise, it would be held 
[cw: downe]

===

$*Of the Hives,/*/$

downe to the place with two forked stickes, the fork resting upon the Belt, and the other end under the Cap.
\23. *The hackle now and then to be taken off./*/ The Hackle thus fitted and placed, is now and then to be removed, not onely to meet with Mise, Moths, Spiders, Erewigs, &c. which harbour under it, and to see what breaches the Mouse and Tit-mouse have made; but also to ayre the moist Hive: and this in a warme and windy day after much wet. 
\24. *The Hives alwaies close cloomed./*/ Next keepe the Hives alwaies close for defence of the Bees against their enimies. The best cloome for that purpose is made of Neats dung: *circumlini alveos fimo bubulo utilissimum/*: \Nat hist.li 21.cap.14./ but to harden it, temper it with Lime or Ashes, with sand or gravell, which are also good against the gnawing of Mise. With this cloome close up the skirts & brackes of your Hives: that there be no way into them, but onely by the doores.
\25. *Then seldome to be moved./*/ And being thus safely shut, move them not without urgent occasion; *v./* \*V.n./* 48.49.53.*&/*67*&.c./*8.*&/*9./ for often lifting up the Hive and letting in the open aire doth discourage the stall. 
\26. *How a Hive lifted up is to be set downe again./*/ But whensoever you are occasioned so to doe (the Bees being stirring) lest any be crushed betweene the skirts and the stoole in setting it downe againe, teele up one side with a little tile-shard, which, when the Bees are quiet, take away, and see the Hive close cloomed againe. 
\27. *The Hive-doore./*/ The Bees entrance, as anon in this Chapter is shewed, must be sometime larger, sometime lesse, sometime nothing at all. And therefore every Bee-Hive must have his Gate or Summer-doore, a Winter-doore or wicket, a Barre or shutting of the wicket.
\28. *The Gate or Summer-doore./*/ The Gate or Summer-doore must be made of that size, that the Bees in Summer, when their number is greatest, may have aire enough, with free egresse and regresse, not letting one another. The space of foure square inches is sufficient for any stall.
This Summer-doore is made thus: First cut away the lowest roule the space of five inches: and, with the Briar or Thred which bound that part, make fast both ends. Then fill up againe the two extreme halfe-inches of the space, with two Doore-posts. 
[cw: The]

===

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

\29. *Of the doore-posts, and the use of them./*/ The Doore-posts are two spleets halfe and inch broad, and five or six inches long, whereof the lowest inch is twice so thicke as the other, with a shouldering on the in-side. These Posts forced up through the middle of the roules in their place, to the shouldering, as they serve to size out the Summer-doore to his due space of foure square inches; so are they fit to receive the Winter-doore, *v:/* \*V./*n.30./ when it shall be joyned unto them. If the Hive be with the least, you may set up the Posts without cutting the roule.
In a Wicker-hive the Summer-doore is made more easily. 
Sometime, namely when a Hive is reared, moveable posts are requisite: which may serve also at other times. A moveable Post is an inch-square peece of wood, with a shouldering above to rest against the Hive: and another in the inside of the doore to fit the wicket: the forme is this. 
{diagram}
\30. *The Winter-doore, or Wicket./*/ The Winter-doore or Wicket is made of a peece of wood, an inch and a quarter thicke, almost an inch high, and five inches long. At each end whereof cut away halfe an inch all save before, where that halfe inch in length must be at least a quarter thicke, with his full heighth to fit the doore-posts: then in the middle of the neather side, cut, through the thicknesse, a hollownesse or passage, almost halfe an inch high, and three inches long: and then there will remaine at each end of the hollownesse halfe an inch uncut, besides the two extreme halfe inches leaft a quarter thicke, and fitted to the Posts.
The fashion of which wicket you may see in this figure.

{diagram}
\31. *The use of it./*/ The use of the Winter-doore is to straighten the passage when there needeth not so much roome, that the Bees may the better keepe out the Robbers, that the Cold may have the lesse force, and that the Mice may not enter, which in winter are wont to make much spoile. *v.c./*7.*n./*3.
\32. *The Barre./*/ The Barre or shutting is to be made foure square of some heavy matter, as namely of Lead (that neither the rough wind nor craftie Titmouse *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*4./ may remove it) in +length, depth, and thicknesse fitting to the wicket: with some little hollownesse next the stoole, that may let in the aire, and not let out the Bees.
+The length may be three inches and an halfe, the thicknesse three quarters, the depth halfe an inch: and the length of the hollownesse two inches and an halfe, the depth halfe a quarter of an inch.
For want of Lead or other mettall, you may with a hammer and grind-stone fit a Tile-shard: but let that be somewhat broad, that it may lie the faster on the stoole. 
\33. *The use of it./*/ With this Barre you may shut or halfe shut the Wicket, as you shall see cause; to defend the Bees in the more dangerous times from Frost, Snow, Titmise, and Robbers. 
For small stalls, the Gate, Wicket, and Barre, may be all of a lesse size. 
\34. *The Settle./*/ It is also convenient for each hive to have his Settle before him: which may be a planke of the bredth of the stoole, and of that length that it may stand leaning from the ground to the fore-part of the stoole: that thereon the Bees may settle when they come wearie or thronging home, and so ascend to the doore; and that there they may sunne and refresh themselves being chilly and wearie. Otherwise you may make a narrow planke or boord to serve, fitting the length of it to the bredth of the stooles, and then the one edge leaning to the fore-part of the stoole, let the other bee

borne up with two forked stakes set fast in the ground, or by some other props. 
\35. *How to order the Bee-hives throughout the yeare./*/ BEe-hives being thus fitted with all necessaries, are afterward at divers times of the yeare to be diversly ordered. 
\36. *The moneths and quarters of the/* Melissæan *yeare/*/ The *Melissæen/* yeare is most fitly measured by the Astronomicall monthes (which begin with the Sunnes entrance into the severall signes of the Zodiack, and are therefore called by their names) because as the Sunne, entring into the twelve signes, and so beginning these twelve moneths, doth notoriously alter his course, making the daies longer or shorter, the aire warmer or colder, and the earth more fruitfull or barren, making also both the *Æquinoctia/* and *Solstitia/*, in which the foure quarters of the yeare, Spring, Summer, Autumne and Winter take their beginnings; so the most notable alterations about Bees, in things either to be observed in them, or to be done for them, doe likewise fall out in the beginnings of these moneths.
But the foure Quarters the Bees begin one moneth sooner than the Astronomers. For their Spring or first quarter beginneth with *Pisces,/* when the Sunne beginneth by his quickning heat to revive the flowers, which all the dead of Winter lay buried in the ground; and the Bees having tasted thereof beginne to breed, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*12./ and to increase their companies for the fruits of ensuing Summer, which from the former Summer hitherto have daily decreased: the other Spring moneths are *Aries/* and *Taurus,v.n./*63.*&c./*
Their Summer likewise containeth *Gemini, Cancer,/* and *Leo/*, most rich and plentifull in flowers and dewes, *v:/* \*V.c./*6.*n./*38.*&c./*/ wherewith the multiplied Bees doe now store their Cells against the penurie of Winter. *v.n./*37.
Their Autumne or Harvest, hath *Virgo, Libra,/* and *Scorpio:/* in which the Bee-masters *v:/* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*2./ and the Master-Bees *v:/* \*V.c./*7.*n./*25.*&/*28./ doe reape the reape the ripe fruits of many Bees labours. *v:n./*44.
And their Winter consisteth of the three *still/* moneths: *v./* \*v.n./*59/.in which the Bees live altogether upon thsir Summer-store, and get nothing.*v.n./*58.
Heere note, that although Winter and Summer doe pro-

+Namely, when they are mentioned together in a kind of opposition: as *c./*2.*n./*7. where you reade, neither very cold in Winter, nor very hot in Summer. *Locus æstate non fervidus, hyeme tepidus, &c./* Which two opposite parts the Poet doth fitly distinguish and describe by the two times of fodering and of pasturing Sheepe and Goats.

*In saltus utrumque gregem & Pascua mittes./*
\Metam.lib.6./ But they are more certainly notified by the comming of the Fieldfare, and of the Swallow: the one bringing cold Winter, the other warme Summer with her. Hir Sister *Philomela/*, that shrowdes hir selfe in the woods, is wont a little to prevent hir, observing more the time of the yeare, then the disposition of the aire: For she is heard commonly the last weeke in *Aries,/* though it bee then cold and winterly weather: whereas *Progne/* stayeth after that untill she finde it warme abroad. If some foolish one or other chance to start out of hir Dormitorie sooner, the Proverbe then is verified, One Swallow makes not a Summer. 
\37. SUMMER./The Spring having replenished the Hives with plentie of Bees, the Summer is readie with his plentie of Honie to entertaine them. During which season the Hives must have their largest entrance. *v:/* \*V.n./*28./ lest the thronged multitudes be pestered for want of aire, or doe let one an other as they goe and come earnest in their worke, or bee stayed in swarming when they should passe at pleasure. Neither can the opennesse of the Hives be hurtfull unto them, seeing now there is no feare of enemies.

\38. In GEMINI *set the doores wide open./*/ At *Gemini/* therefore set the doores *v:/* \*V.n./*28./ wide open, without Barre or Wicket: and so let them stand all this quarter.  
*Gemini/* being past, if the weather be usually coole, when there commeth a calme warme day, take off the hackles from those Hives that are likely to swarme. But if the weather be extreme hot and dry, then it is good to keepe on the hackles to coole the Hives, &c.*v.c./*5.*n./*21.

\41. *To keepe them from swarming./*/ When you would have no more swarmes, as namely after the first blowing of Blackberries, *v:/* \*V.c./*5.*n/*11./ which is commonly within a seven night after Midsummer, set up those Hives that are full with three Tile-shards, or other things of like thicknesse, and cloome up the space betweene the hive and the stoole: If yet they chance to swarme, as soone as they are hived, put them backe to the stocke, *v.c./*5.*n./*11.
Also reare the swarmes that being under-hived doe lie forth, with bolsters of that thicknesse that may but let in the Bees.

\43. *How and when to kill the Drones./*/ And if you see any other so pestered with multitudes, that they are loath to meddle with them; you shall doe well to helpe them some warme afternoone, and then will they take the worke out of your hand, and spend the lesse time about it.
\44. HARVEST/ To the plentifull Summer succeedeth wastfull Autumne. 
\45. VIRGO./ At *Virgo/* therefore, or a little before, (which is the most dangerous time for Bees, because of the Waspes that then, if not sooner, learne the way into the Hives, but chiefely of robbing Bees, which then begin to spoile) *v:/* \*V.c./*7.*n./*28./ and see that the Hives bee close in all places. (Those that have lien forth or otherwise be verie full, you may let alone and not straighten their entrance till the weather bee colder, for such as are safe enough.)
\47. *Set up the Winter-doores./*/ But first view your swarmes whether they fit their Hives: those that have not now wrought downe within a handfull of the stoole, if you meane to keep them (to the end they may lye warme the Winter following, and be ready at the doores to keepe out robbers) cut off so much of the skirts as will serve the turne (the bigger the Hive is, the more you may lessen him) and so set him downe, cut a Summer-doore *v:/*\*V.n./*28./ in the skirt, and put to the Winter-doore. Without such help the cold will kill many, and weaken all, whereby they

become unlustie in all their doings: as the Philosopher well noted, *Si alveus justo amplior sit, desidiosiores redduntur./* \Hist.l.9.c.40./
\48. *And keepe them shut til they offer to go abroad./*/ Moreover, because the Waspes and robbing Bees will be stealing betimes, before the true Bees be stirring; it is good in the evening, when the Bees are all in, to barre up the Wickets of those that are weake, that a Bee cannot passe: and not to open the same the next day till the weather be warme, and the Bees offer to come abroad, though it be not before nine, or ten, or eleven a clock: and then you may either open it, or halfe-open it, according to the flight of your Bees, *v./* \*V.n./*33./
\49. *The reared stalls now to be set downe againe./*/ The stalls which you reared in the end of *Cancer/* for feare of swarming or want of roome, *v:/* (now that the death of the old Bees *v:/*\*V.n./*41./ and of the Drones *v:/* \*V.c./*1.*n./*55./ hath made roome) are to be set downe againe, *v:/* \*V.c./*4.*n./*25.*&c.V.n./*26./lest their swarming be hindred the next yeare: unlesse they be swarmes that have wrought downe to the stoole. 
\50 *In Virgo try whether the Bees will live./*/ Also in this moneth, about the middle, those Hives which you deeme to be weake because the Bees are gone up from the doore, knocke with your hand, one after an other: they that at the first or second stroke doe make a great noise both above and beneath, continuing the same for a space, have store of Bees, and are therefore in lesse danger: but those that make a little short noise, though they be heavy and have Honie enough (such as are commonly those of three yeare old, & upward, that have cast twice or oftner that yeare, and did not by *Virgo/* beate away their Drones) yet have they but few Bees, and are therefore ill able to resist the violent multitude of Robbers: which, when they perceive their weaknesse, will never leave them, as long as there is a drop of Honie in the Hive. 
If you see them once fighting, *v/*\*V.c./*7.*n./*45./ either presently take them, or make the entrance so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once: and before *Libra/* bee sure to take them. For though they escape this robbing-time through your care and diligence; yet at the Spring they will surely yeeld, or die of themselves, or flie away. Note yet, that those stalls which are very full, will make but a little noise when you knocke them, (but different from the other, as being quicke, smart,

\51. *Now take the Combes./*/ In the end of this moneth is the time to kill and drive Bees,*v.c./*10.*part./*1.*n./*2.*&/*13. Some Bees faile after *Virgo:/* and therefore it is good to make triall of them in *Libra/* also, by poysing and knocking the Hives; for as they that then make+ a little noise will die for lacke of company; so thet that are light will die for lack of meat. And alwaies have an eye to those that the Robbers doe eagerly haunt: which is a signe that they perceive in them some defect or other: and therefore will not be answered without their errand.
+A little short noise above in the Hive, specially when in the end some few single Bees endeavour by their earnest and continued sound to seeme many, bewraieth their paucity and decaying.
Such as by these meanes you finde unlikely to live, take or drive: those that you suspect, and yet are willing to keep; marke them, feed them in due time, and prove them againe in *Pisces/* and *Aries./* 
\54. *Now set up the wickets to the best, and keep the rest shut till the Bees offer to goe abroad./*/ At *Libra,/* or before you see cause, set up the Winter-doores of the best, and then diligently in the evenings shut all those in with the Barre, that have leaft watching at the doore. For in the cold mornings, while the true Bees keepe in, because it is not fit time for them to gather in; the theeves, both Waspes & Bees will be abroad, seeking where they may breake in and steale. But still let the weaker have their Wickets halfe-shut.

\58. WINTER./ After Autumne, the Sunne drawing neere the Winter Tropicke, with a short and low course above our *Horison,/* there follow three *still/* moneths, *Saggitarius, Capricornus,/* and *Aquarius:/* \59.SAGIT.CAPRIC.AQUAR. three *still/* moneths./in which as the plants lie still in the earth waiting the Sunnes returne to revive them; so the Bees lie *still/* in their Hives, passing this fruitlesse time in sleepe and slumber. Yet so, that if there happen a milde and warme houre, they presently perceiving it awake out of their swivet, and hye them out of doores with all alacrity: that they may take the fresh aire, recreate themselves, drinke, exercise their wings, carry out their dead and other noysomenesse, and lighten their little bellies, which are oft times so stuffed, when the wether suffreth them not to goe abroad, that they can hold no more: so loth are they to defile their nests. And having thus refreshed themselves, at their returne, they take their repast, and then betake them againe to their rest. But many such daies, specially in time of scarcity, are dangerous, as causing them to spend much of their store, which in *still/* frosts they would spare.
\61. *The first sharpe weather in Capr. shut the Bees in./*/ The first foule and cold weather in *Capricorne/* shut the Wickets close, to save the Bees from the Tit-mouse, *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*6./ and from the cold, as well within the Hive as without. For as the frost and snow and cold winds, yea and the ordinary disposition of the aire doth chill many of them, whom the flattering sun-shine enticeth abroad; so the great frosts, striking through the doore doe freeze the nethermost in the Hive to death: so that by little and little many stalls in some winters have been thereby wholly destroyed: the which, by keeping them warme, might have beene preserved. But when you shut them in, be sure the Hives be alwaies close and sure: \62. *And in pleasant weather let them loose, if it may be, once a fortnight./*/ for the Bees when they awake will strive by all meanes to come forth, though they never finde the way in againe. Yet when there happenenth any pleasant day (namely when the sunne shineth, the winde is still, or bloweth mildly out of the South or West, and the earth is without frost & snow) is it is very behovefull to give them leave to play, *v./* \*V.n./*59.*&c./*1.*n./*59./ and to refresh

$*and the Dressing of them./*/$

themselves: once in a fortnight or three weekes is to be wished, specially after *Capricorne/* is past: but if you or the weather shut them in much longer, they will be so faint and feeble through their long restraint, that without very pleasant weather at their comming abroad, a number of them will be chilled while they rest themselves but a little in the open aire. And therefore as often as, for this purpose, the doore is a little opened; alter it not, untill the weather alter: and when *Aquarius/* is halfe spent, if, for feare of a piercing night-frost, you barre them up in the evening; let them goe againe in the morning, unlesse either snow or boysterous windes forbid you. In winter provide your Hives.*v.n./*7.
\63. The SPRING./ The still Moneths of Winter being past, the new yeere entreth with *Pisces/*, the first moneth of the Spring: when the Plants begin to sprout, and the Bees to breed againe.  
\64. PISCES./ 
\65. *The first faire day in Pisces, set the Bees at libertie./*/ Now therefore, if not sooner, the weather being faire, halfe open the wickets of the better sort, and so let them stand day and night. For the night-cold, being now shorter and weaker, is not dangerous to such: and the day-cold doth them more good then hurt, causing them to lie still and spare their store, untill it be fit time to goe abroad. But for the weaker swarmes (which are more subject to cold, and robbing that now beginneth afresh, *v./*) \*v.c./*7.*n./*27./ shut them close in the evenings, and open them not in the mornings untill it be warme: and then give them but roome for a Bee or two to passe, specially those that stand most warme in the Sunneshine, which maketh the robbers able to endure the siege, whom otherwise the aires chilnesse would quickly discourage.  
\66. *Now dresse their Troughes./*/ And now (the Bees beginning to breed, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*12.*&c./*6.*n./*53./ is the time to dresse and fill their Troughs, which all the winter lay neglected. 
\67. *Clense the stools./*/ At this time, in a morning before the Bees come much abroad, lift up your Hives: and quickly sweeping the dead Bees and other noysomenesse away, and scraping cleane the stooles, set them downe againe, *v./* \*V.n./*26./ and cloome them close as before. For albeit the Bees in time would rid them cleane themselves; yet shall it be good for them to have done it at 
[cw: once,]

once, that they be neither hindered, nor annoyed therewith: and now and then the carrying out of a dead Bee at this time of the yeere doth cost a quicke Bee hir life: for being drawne with the weight of the corps to the cold ground; while she standeth panting a little, she is chilled, and so not able to rise any more. 
This cleansing of the stooles, after a calme *Aquarius,/* when the Bees have beene much abroad, is not so necessarie, and specially for the better stalls.
\68. *And feede or drive light stalls./*/ Those that by their lightnesse you perceive to lack honey, you may now save by feeding, *v.c./*8.*n./*11. or driving them into others that have store. *v.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*15.
\69. ARIES./ 
\70. *The second chiefe robbing time./*/ *Aries/* is almost as dangerous a moneth, for robbing, as *Virgo:/* and therefore you must have a care in the evenings to shut the Wickets, & in the mornings not, before it be warm, to halfe-open them againe: and where the drie winds and hot sunne have shrunke the cloome, be carefull to fill up the chinkes againe. 
The poore stalls this moneth would be halfe-shut all the day, as in *Virgo/* and *Libra./*
\71. *In/* TAURUS *remove the bars./*/ At *Taurus/*, and sooner, if sooner you see+ cause, removing the Barres from the better stalls, set the Wickets open: and for the weaker sort, let them all this moneth be shut in the evenings: and in the mornings, as soone as it is warme, be but halfe-opened. 
+That is, when either they keepe watch at the dore in the evenings, or be so encreased that they cannot easily passe too and fro in their worke: for if the passage seeme too streight onely in their playing fit, *v.c./*1.*n./*59. that maketh no matter. 
\72. *In/* GEMINI *the winter doores./*/ At Gemini take away the Wickets from the better, & the Barres from the weaker stalls: and when this moneth is halfe past, make them all alike: leaving the doores as they were in *Gemini/* before. *v.n./*38.

##*Of the Breeding of Bees, and/* of the Drone./##


\1. *The Drone no labourer/*/{T}HE Drone, which is a grosse Hive-Bee without sting, hath been alwaies reputed a greedy lozell: (and therefore hee that is quicke at meat and slow at worke is fitted with this title) for howsoever he brave it with his round velvet cap, his side gowne, his full panch, and his lowd voice; yet is he but an idle companion, living by the sweat of others brows. For hee worketh not at all, either at home or abroad, and yet spendeth as much as two labourers: you shall never find his maw without a good drop of the purest *nectar/*. In the heat of the day he flieth abroad, aloft, and about, and that with no small noise, as though he would doe some great act: but it is onely for his pleasure, and to get him a stomach, and then returnes he presently to his cheere. *Fuci cum exeunt efferunt sese fusium in sublimi gyroque volitant: quod ubi satis jam fecerint, redeunt domum, & epulis perfruuntur./* \Hist.an.li.9.c.40./ But for all this there is such necessary use of him, that he may not be spared, as without whom the Bee cannot bee.
\2. *Divers opinions of the Drones originall./*/ The generall opinion anent the Drone is, that he is made of a hony-Bee, that hath hir sting: which is even as likelie, as that a dwarfe having his guts pulled out, should become a gyant. Others seeing the fondnesse of this opinion, have thought and taught that the Drone is a different *species,/* and that as Bees breed Bees, so Drones breed Drones: which conceit (if the Author had observed, that at the time of their breeding and many moneths before, there is not a Drone left alive to breed them) hee would have liked as well as the 
[cw: former.]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees,/*/$

former. These opinions then, being one as likely as the other, let them goe together. The truth is, they are of the same *species/* with the hony-Bee, but of a different *Sex./*
\3. *The Drone is the Male-Bee./*/ For albeit he be not seene to ingender with the hony-bee, *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*53/ either abroad, as other *insecta/* doe, or within the Hive, (where yet you may by means behold what they do;) *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*6.*&/*7/ yet without doubt is he the Male-Bee, by whose naturall heat and masculine vertue the hony-Bee, which breedeth both hony-Bees and Drones, *v./* \*V.n./*18./ secretly conceiveth. 
\4. *Divers reasons proving the Drone to be the Male. The first reason is, that they are suffered in breeding time onely/*/ The reasons that move me thus to thinke, are these. First, because although they be great wasters of the Bees store, yet until they begin to leave breeding, and have conceived for the next yeere, (which some do about *Leo/*, most before *Virgo/*) they suffer them: afterward they begin to beat them away. Which if some doe not, before *Scorpio/* they die naturally: and from thenceforth all the Winter, untill the Bees breed new againe, *v./* \*V.n./*18.*&/*19./ there is not a Drone to be had *In rerum natura/*. \Nat hist l.11.c.11./ When they are quite gone, then doe the Bees lay no more seeds that yeere, but onely hatch and breed up those that are already in the celles. \*V.c./*5.*n./*4./
\5.*The second reason is that the Drones being taken away in breeding time the Bees breed no more./*/ Secondly, as the rather and the more the Drones are, the more and greater are the swarmes; (*Certe quo major fuerit fucorum multitudo, eo major fiet examinum proventus; v./*) \*v.c./*5 *n/*4./ so where the Drones are few and late, there is small increase: and therefore if you kill the Drones of a Hive before the Bees have done swarming and breeding (as some fondly have don before Mid-sommer, to save their hony from these lazie lurchers) neither will the swarmes come forth that were formerly bred, nor the stocke thenceforth breed any more. After which time bringing in *Ambrosia v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*18./ as much as before, and having no young ones to spend part, they lay it up carelesly in their cells, where it corrupteth and turneth to stinking stopping *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n/*19.*&/*20./ which will cause them so much to mislike their Hive, that the next *Virgo/* they will easily yeeld to the Robbers *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*25./ And if by your industry they be then preserved; in *Pisces,/* when breeding time is, finding their wombes barren, and therefore loathing even themselves and all, they yeeld their goods to them that will take it: and 
[cw: after]

$*and of the Drones./*/$

after a while, when the strange Bees and they smell all alike, by conversing together in the same Hive, and sucking the same hony, away they goe with them to their Drones. But every faire day they will returne to fetch that they leaft behinde them: you may see them flie so thicke to and fro that hive, as if it were full of Bees: but when night is come, they are all gone. 
\6. *The third reason is, that they are bred by the Bees./*/ Thirdly, because *omne simile generat sibi simile/*, Every living thing doth breed Male, or Female of his kinde, and experience doth teach us that the Bees doe yeerely breed, as well Drones as honi-bees; *v./* \*V+ in annot.&n./*12,*&/*c./ seeing the honi-bees are females, it followeth necessarily that the Drones are the Males of the same kind. And therefore in the learned Languages the Drone hath his +Masculine appellation, as the Honi-bee hir feminine. 
+*Hic fucus [greek]: Ac hæc apis, [greek] [hebrew] cum [hebrew] fœminino. Melissa/* the daughter of *Meissus/* King of Crete, being one of *Jupiters/* nurces, is said to have beene by him transformed into the Honi-Bee: which retaineth still her gender, sex, and name. *Didymus aijt duas Melissi fuisse filias, Almatheum & Melissam, quæ Jovem puerum caprino lacte & melle nutrierant./* Lact.lib.1.instit.c.22. *Nec sane rustico dignum est sciscitari, fueritne mulier pulcherrima specie Melissa, quam Jupiter in Apem convertit./* Columella.lib.10.c.2.

\7. *The fourth reason is, that the wasps and dorres have drones, which are their males./*/ Fourthly, wee see the like in the likest *insecta/* the Waspe and the Dorre: for the manifesting whereof I wil briefly shew you the breeding of them both. 
\8 *The breeding of wasps by drones./*/ The Waspes neast is begun by one great Waspe, which you may therefore call the Mother-waspe: the which in *Cancer/* (or in hot and dry springs somewhat rather) within some hole, usually made in the ground by a Moale, Mouse, or other meanes, worketh a Comb of the utter drix of pales, or other timber, in forme of a round tent hanging by the top to the over-part of the hole. This combe containeth about six Cells, of the bignesse and fashion of the Bees cells, wherein she breedeth so many young ones: which, when they are fledge, doe breed as well as their dam: and so enlarge the combe to some eight inches over. Then, making more room beneath by moining and carrying out the earth, they hang an other combe under the first, by little pinns, and so an other, 
[cw: and]

$*Of the Breeding of Bees,/*/$

and an other, increasing still in the same place till Summer be done. For they goe not forth in swarmes as Bees doe. \Hist.l.9.c.42./ *Missio, ut apum, nulla vel crabronum vel vesparum fieri solet: sed qui subinde oriantur novelli ibidem manent, & alveum terrâ egestâ faciunt ampliorem./* When their breeding draweth toward an end, namely in *Virgo/* and after, (besides the small or ordinary Waspes, which lie in all the upper combes) in the last or lowest combe, made for the nonce with larger cells fit for larger bodies, they breed also two other sorts, Drones or Male-waspes (which are somewhat bigger and longer than the small Waspes, and without stings as the Drone-bees) and Mother-Waspes, which are like the small ones in all respects save that they are twice so bigge. These when they are fledge having conceived, as the Bees, by the Drones; in *Libra,/* and sometime sooner, doe flie abroad (as their Drones also doe) gathering information for themselves, and searching and prying into every corner as they goe, for their Winter-lodging: and after a while, when the aire waxeth cold, leaving both Drones and small Waspes to the mercy of Winter (which with his first cold-wet wether chilleth and killeth them as they flie abroad) do forthwith betake themselves to some warme place, as the thatch of an house, a mortice in a post, an auger-hole, or the like; but specially into hollow trees, (which is the cause, why in grounds adjoyning to Woods their neasts will be most rife) where they abide till the next spring without any meat, as it were in a dead sleepe: out of the which neverthelesse a little warmth of the fire, or of your hand will awake them at any time. At the blowing of Palme, if the weather be warme, they flie abroad for food: and in *Cancer/* or *Gemini/*, as I have said, they begin to nestle and breed. He that killeth one of them killeth a whole neast of Waspes. 
+When the old Mother-Waspe hath done breeding, and hir wings are so worne, that she is not able to helpe her selfe, the little ones keepe her so long as they live together. Before the young Mother-Waspes are bred, you may easily fine her among the little ones: but when they are fledge, you cannot know her from one of them, but by hir ragged wings.
[cw: And]

$*and of the Drone./*/$


And that the Drone-waspes are the males, some were of opinion in the daies of *Aristotle/* for thus he writeth. \His.li.9.41./ *Si vespam ex pedibus ceperis bombilareque, siveris, advolant quæ aculeo carent: quod non faciunt, quæ aculeatæ sunt. Itaque argumento quidam hoc utuntur quod alteræ mares sunt, alteræ fœminæ:/* which argument seemeth not unprobable, seeing the Fowlers counterfeiting the call of the Hen-Quailes catch only the Cocks.
\9.*The breeding of Dorres by drones./*/ The Dorre likewise beginneth hir neast single, being more like the Bee then the Waspe is, in that she maketh Honie, and more unlike in the fashion of hir Combs: for she hath only a few round cels of the bignesse of grapes, lying flat on the ground one upon another without any order: the which are made after this manner. First either upon the ground in the grasse, or in some shallow hole within the ground, shee prepareth a little stuffe which is soft like Wax, but browne and more brittle, of the bignesse of hir head; and therein she layeth about six or seaven seedes together, compassing them round with the same stuffe: which increaseth by little and little as the seedes doe: and when they begin to live, it groweth into so many severall Cells, as there are grubs, each one having one to himselfe. When they become to their bignesse, the Cells, which before were browne and brittle, doe now wax white and tough, that you can scarce teare them. And when the Dorres are ripe, they gnaw their way out at the top. Upon these they make more in like manner, and the void open Cells they fill with Honie, wherewith they feed both themselves and their young, when the weather suffreth them not to flie abroad. All this neast is covered with a little Mosse like a Birds-neast. Untill *Leo/* they breed females onely as the Waspes doe: and then last of all, for propagation of their kind, they breed their Drones, being likewise, as the Drones of Bees and Waspes, without stings. And these, to put the matter out of doubt, within a moneth after when they are ripe, doe openly engender with their females, as the chaffers doe, but their mates they choose in the neast, and are carried away by them. After which time the females breed no more till the next Summer,
[cw: though]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees,/*/$

though you may see them gathering, and flying about somewhat longer then the Waspes. In *Saggitarius/* they betake themselves to their Winter-rest, where they lie single as the Mother-Waspe in a sleepe or swivet. But the Drone-dorres, as the Drone-waspes, are destroyed by the weather: not one afterward to be seene till next *Leo/*, when the females breed new againe. But one thing in the Dorres and Waspes is more strange, then in the Bees. For whereas the Bees assone as they have bred their first brood of females, doe presently breede Drones, *v./* \*V.n./*19./ (both which, when they are ripe, multiply together) the young Dorres and Waspes in the beginning of Summer, doe not immediately take the Drones (for then there are none) but receive from their dams, togither with their nature and being, that Masculine seed, wherby when they are ripe they breed all the Summer following, untill in the end they likewise conceive by their late-bred Drones for the next yeare, both for themselves and the young that shall come of them. 
\10. *The fift reason is the apparent signes of their Sex./*/ By this time thou wilt say with me, that the Drone is the male-Bee: Whereof if some curious Chirurgion would make an Anotomie, he should easily discerne *Duos amplos & candidos testes/*, two lawfull witnesses of his Masculine Sex.
\11. Aristotles *Objection answered./*/ This truth began to appeare many yeares agoe, even in *Aristotles/* time. *Aliqui/* (saith he) *mares esse fucos, fœminas vero apes esse contendunt./* Which opinion he reciteth in another place. *Sunt qui fuces mares esse, apes fœminas arbitrentur/*. \His.l.5.c.21./\Generat.l.3.c.10./ Where though he doe not approve it; yet hath he no other resson against it but this. *Arma ad pugnam viresque exercendas nulli fœminæ à natura tribuunutur./* Nature hath armed no female for fight and force against the male: but the Bees have power and weapon to chastice the Drones: *v./* \*v.n./*22./ and therefore the Drones cannot be their males. 
The weaknesse of which reason I marvaile he did not see, seeing in all the kinde of +Hawkes the female doth command the male, as being both stronger and better armed. Whereunto may bee added the example of the *Amazons/* reigning in his time: who by force of armes subdued many kingdomes of men, and held them in subjection: like unto 
[cw: which,]

===

$*and of the Drone./*/$

which, it is marvaile but there were then some mankind Viragoes in *Greece/*, as well as there be now in other Countries. 
Which thing, if nothing else, the experience of his Masters + Master might have taught him.
+The first instance is beyond exception: neither doe I see how the other can be answered, unlesse peradventure it be replayed that such rule is against Nature. 
+*Aristotle/* his Master was *Plato,/* whose Master was *Socrates/*, whose Master was *Xantippe/* that thundring showring Queene of Shrewes. *Xantippe Socratis Philosophi uxor morosa admodum fuisse fertur & jurgiosa: irarumque, & molestiarum muliebrium per diem perque noctem scatebat./* A Gellius l.1.c.17. *Socrates, cum in eum Xantippe prius convitia & maledicta ingessisset, postea vero & sordidis aquis perfudisset, Nonne (inquit) dicebam Xantippen tonantem quandoque pluituram?/* Laertius lib: 2. in vita Socratis.
But you must understand that the Philsopher speaketh thus, not *dogmaticè/* but *disputatvè/*, onely by way of reasoning: for in the end of the same chapter he yeeldeth himselfe to have no certaine knowledge thereof. *Non tamen satis ad huc explorata quæ eveniant habemus./*
\12. *When the Bees begin to breed./*/ To returne therefore to our purpose, the Hony-Bees having, as those other *insecta/*, conceived by the Drones; the best about *Pisces/* when they first gather upon flowers, others in *Aries,/* and the weaker later, begin their breeding: which is continued all the Summer, even to the end of *Virgo./* But the chiefe time is in *Aries, Taurus,/* and *Gemini:/* which moneths yeeld *Ambrosia/* the *Schadons/* food, in greatest plentie, varietie and vertue. \13. *The chiefe time of breeding./*/ 
\14. *The first breed are females./*/ The Bees will be sure to serve themselves first, their first generation being alwaies females: which they breed after this manner. 
\15. *The manner of their breeding./*/Close under the Honie (which is that time altogether in the upper parts of the Combs) in the middle of the bottomes of the void Cels, as the Waspes doe on the one side, they lay their seedes, about the bignesse of those which the Butter-flie leaves upon the Cabage-leaves: but of different colour, the Bees being white like Wasp-seedes, and the Butter-flies yellow. And so they descend by degrees toward the neather part of the Combes, filling one Cell after an other. Although when the chiefe breeding is past, 
[cw: they]

===

$*Of the breeding of Bees,/*/$

they doe not precisely observe this order, but lay up their Honie promiscuously among the yong Bees, where they finde the Cells void. \16. *The Bee-seed is first turned into a Worme./*/ The Bee-seed at the first sticketh upon one end untill it be a live Worme or Grub: as soone as it liveth it is loose, and lyeth in the bottome of the Cell round like a ring, one end touching the other, till so the bottome can no longer containe it: after that, it lieth along in the Cell til it be growen to the full bignesse of a Bee: and then doth the Worme die and becommeth void of all motion and sense: and so is shut up in the Cell, the Bees covering the top close with wax. 
\147. *The Worme being dead groweth to the shape of a Bee and then liveth againe./*/ The Grub being now dead, presently beginneth the alteration from a Worme to a Bee: which, is two-fold, in shape and in colour: the first alteration in shape, is the division in the middle; then the other division betweene the head and shoulders, whence it is called an *insectum:/* after that, the growth of the head, legges, wings, and other parts into their shape and fashion. The first that altereth in colour from white to browne is the upper part, and of the upper part the head, and of the head the eyes.  
The uniforme shape and white colour of the Worme, being thus altered into the proportioned shape and brownish colour of a Bee, she beginneth to move agine, and to live her second life: and then breaking the cover wherewith she was inclosed in the Cell, she commeth forth a flying Bird.
 \Hist.an.l.5.c.22./ *Foetu posito incubant, exclusis inde vermiculus, dum parvus est, jacet in favo obliquus: postea sua ipse facultate se erigit, cibumque capit. Foetus apum & fucorum candidus est: ex quo vermiculi fiunt, qui in apes fucosque transeunt./* And all this within the space of a moneth. Yea in swarming-time, when the Hives have more heat, partly from the aire, and partly from the multitude of Bees; when also the *Schadans/* never want their fill of *Nectar, Ambrosia,/* and faire water continually brought in fresh and fresh unto them; I have knowne this effected in three weekes: although *Plinie/* speakes of more then twice so long a time. *Foetus intra/* 45. *diem peragitur./*
\18. *The breeding of the Lady-Bees/*/ But the Lady-bees are bred in the severall Palaces of the

$*and of the Drone./*/$

Queene, *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*11.*&/*12./ after a peculiar and more excellent manner. For the golden matter whereof they are made is not turned into a Worme at all; but immediately receiveth the shape of a Bee. \Hist.l.5.c.22/ *Primordium regum colore cernitur fulvo, corpulentia mellis crassioris, magnitudine ilico proximâ suæ futuræ soboli: nec primum ex eo vermiculus gignitur, sed statim apis./* Item. \Colum:l.9.c.11/ *Higinius negat ex vermiculo, ut cæteras apes, fieri ducem; sed in circuitu favorum paulo majora, quam sint plebij seminis, inveniri for amina repleta quasi sorde rubri coloris, ex qua protinus alatus rex figuratur./*
\19 *When the Drones are bred./*/ When the old Bees have ended their first broods of females, then last of all after the same manner in wider Cells made for the nonce *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*10./ they breed the Male-bees or Drones: as was long since observed, *Sunt fuci sine aculeo velut imperfectæ apes, novissemque à fessis & jam emeritis inchoatæ, ferotinus fœtus./* \20. *When they come abroad./*/ And therefore some stalls doe not dronie before *Cancer/*, not many before *Gemini/*, nor any before *Taurus/*: although you may see the +Nymphes of good stalls abroad in *Aries/*, of others in *Taurus/*, and of all in *Gemini/*. By chance some few Cephens may be bred betime with the femals: but they, as comming out of season, are not suffered to live. 
+The young Bees are called Schadons: *Schadones sobolem dico./* Hist.l.5.c.22. The brood of females, when they have the shape of Bees, are called Nymphs, and the young Drones Cephens: *Cætera turba, cum formam capere cæpit, Nymphæ vocantur, ut fuci Cephenes/* Pl.li.11.c.11.
\21. *Two uses of the Drones./*/ These Cephens or Drones, when they are fledge, doe not only serve for generation (as hath beene shewed) but also doe helpe the females much, by reason of their great heat, in hatching their broods. *In fœtu adjuvant apes, multum ad calorem conferente turba./* \Nat.hist.li.II.c.II/ \22. *Where they lye./*/ And for these causes they are alwaies in breeding-time mingled with them throughout the Hive. Although afterward (when they have beene much beaten, and can goe no where single, but one or other will be on their jackes) they gather all together in a cluster, for their saftie in one side of the Hive: so that it is true at some time which the Philosopher spake indefinitely, *Tenent alvei locum penitiorem./*. \His.l.9.c.40./ And yet their hanging together will not
[cw: serve]

===

$*Of the Breeding of Bees,/*/$

serve their turne: for the Bees, when they are disposed, will quickly make them part, and depart. When there is no use of them, there will be no roome for them.
\23. *The male-Bees are subject to the females./*/ For the Drones are but vassals to the Honie-bees: which as they doe excell them in virtue and goodnesse, so doe they also in power and authoritie, ruling and over-ruling them at their pleasures. \Nat:hist,li.11.c.11./ *Sunt quasi servitia verarum apum: quamobrem imperant ijs./* For albeit generally among all creatures the males, as more worthy, doe master the females; yet in these, the females have the preeminence: and, by the Grammarians leave, the Feminine gender is more worthy then the Masculine, *Hæc apes/* then *hic fucus, hæc Nympha/* then *hic Cephen./* But let no nimble tongued Sophisters gather a false conclusion from these true premisses, that they, by the example of these, may arrogat to themselves the like superioritie: for *Ex particulare non est syllogizare,/* & he that made these to command their males, commanded them to be commanded. But if they would so fain to have it so, let them first imitate their singular virtues, their continuall industry in gathering, their diligent watchfulnesse in keeping, their temperance, chastitie, cleanlinesse, and discreet œconomie, &c. And then, if they meete with such dull Lubbers as these Drones are; they may with lesse blame borrow a point of the Law, and enjoy their longing. Yet when they have it, let them use poore Skimmington as gently as they may; especially in publike, to hide his shame.  
And this they may note by the way, that albeit the females in this kinde have the Soveraigntie, yet have the males the lowder voice, as it is in other living things, Doves, Owsils, Thrushes, &c. the males being knowne by their sounding and shrill notes from the silent females. Yea the wives themselves will not suffer that Hen to live, which presumeth to crow as the Cock doth: nature teaching that silence, and soft noise becommeth that Sex. 
\24. *When the Bees leave breeding and beat away their Drones./*/ The Bees breeding or laying of seeds beginneth to cease, in some by *Leo/*, in some not before *Virgo/*. After which time these+ *Amazonian/* Dames, having conceived for the next yeere, begin to wax wearie of their mates, and to like their

roome better then their company. At first not quite forgetting their old familiaritie, they gently give them Tom Drums entertainment: they that will not take that for a warning, but presume to force in againe among them, are more shrewdly handled. You may sometime see a handfull or two before a Hive, which they had killed within: but the greatest part flyeth away, and dieth abroad. 
\25. *The Bees compared to the/* Amazons./
*Amazones bellicosæ erant Scythiæ mulieres, quæ cum viris exultantes in Cappadociæ ora juxta amnem Thermodonta consederunt: ubi viris plerique; per insidias accolarum trucidatis, reliquos qui domi remanserant, ut ipsæ solæ rerum potirentur, interficiunt: & armis sumptis etiam cum contemptu hostium se strenue tuentur, & imperium longe lateque: in Europam & Asiæ partem tandem proferunt. Ne vero genus periret, finitimis tanquam maritis ututntur: quos officio functos abigunt: Atque; quot pariunt virgines fovent, & armis exercent masculos vero duræ enecant: unde eas Aeorpata i. Viricidas appellant Scythæ, ut tradit Herodot.l.4. Prima harum regina Marthesia vel Marpesia dicebatur:quæ plures quidem peperit filias, ut Antiopen, Orithyam, Menalippen, & Hypoliten: è quibus duæ majores natu matri successerunt, cæteræ imperium non sunt adeptæ. Amazonum itaque; regnum apum rempublicam aptissime refert: Marpesia apum reginam quæ plures solet producere fœtus: Antiope & Orithya primores filias, quæ primum & secundum examen educunt, iisque moderantur: Menalippe & Hypolite eas principes quæ aut nequaquam aut nequicquam dominantur. Nam post secundum examen aut in alveis morantes morte mulctantur, *v./* \*v.c./*I.*n./*7./ aut egressæ fere fame pereunt, *v.c./*8.*n./*4. Utriusq; etiam populi mores non minùs conveniunt: nam & apes fœminæ sunt bellicosæ, quæ non modo Europam & quandam Asiæ partem, ut illæ; sed universa orbis terrarum imperia possident: quæ sui sexus prolem summa itidem cura enutrientes, mares omnes tam viros quam filios cædere solent: ut & ipsæ vere Æorpata dici possint./*
\26. *They rid not their Drones all at once./*/ But because in the same Hive they doe not leave breeding all at once; therefore neither doe they kil their Drones all at once: but at the first taking away onely the superfluous, they suffer as many as they need, to remaine longer: some sometime a while moneth after. 
\27. *When forward stalls begin./*/ The forward stockes, that have cast their last swarme in *Gemini/* or soone after, begin at *Leo/*: \28. *When the backward./*/ yea of those in the beginning of *Gemini/* some somewhat sooner, the backward, that cast not their last swarme much before *Leo/* may stay till the end of the same moneth: but usually about *Virgo,/* or a weeke after, they make a cleane riddance of them. 
[cw: Those]

$*Of the Breeding of Bees,/*/$

\29. *When full stockes that have not swarmed./*/ Those stockes that being full have not swarmed at all, because they are rich and feare no want, use to suffer them so long and sometime longer, even to the ende of this moneth. 
\30. *When those that are overswarmed./*/ Those that have over-swarmed themselves, finding their paucitie and weaknesse, wax desperate and carelesse of their estate: and therefore sometime keepe their Drones till toward the end of *Virgo/*, sometime kill them not at all: but let them alone, untill they die by nature: which is not long after. For few of them can live till *Libra/*, and the youngest not to the end of that moneth. *v./* \*V.n./*4./ Take heed to such stalls, for they are likely to die.
\31. *Sometime the Bees cast out even the white Cephens./*/ Some are so provident, that, to prevent this trouble and save their Honie, they draw the poore Cephens out of their Cells before they be ripe, or come to their second life. Such you may safely trust.
\32. *Timely ridding of Drones a good signe./*/Those that soonest rid their Drones, are likely to be forwardest the next yeare.
\33. *Sometime they rid their Drones in the Spring./*/ Sometimes the Drones are beaten away in the Spring. For when forward stalls (which in their heat are bold to fly abroad while others dare not wagge) have lost many of their Nymphes in a tempestuous and stormie Spring; they will therefore destroy their Drones also. \34. *And afterward breed new againe./*/ But having formerly conceived by them, they then begin the world anew as after an other Winter: and first breeding Nymphs, in the end they breed Cephens againe. Which if they can compasse before swarming time be past, they will swarme that yeare; otherwise they will be fat and full, and excellent good either to keepe or  kill.
\35 *Sometime it is good to helpe the Bees in this work./*/ Because the stockes that have cast often, doe beare with their Drones so long, although there be twise so many as bee needfull for the Bees that are leaft; therefore (to save the Honie which those Wolmores would devoure) it is not amisse to prevent the Bees, and presently after the last swarme to diminish their number, with a Drone-pot cloomed to the doore: specially of them you meane to take, or see much opprest with superfluous multitude, *v.c./*3.*n./*43.

##* Of the Swarming of Bees, and the/* Hiving of them./##


\1. *The parts of a swarme./*/ {T}He stocks having bred and filled their Hives do send forth swarmes. A swarme doth consist of all such parts as the stocke doth: namely of a Queene-bee, Honie-bees as well old as young, and Drone-bees. 
\2. *When you may see the Queene-Bee./*/ If any man desire to see the Queene, he hath now opportunitie, when she goeth forth with hir swarme: *v/* \*v.n./*34/ and dead ones he may finde many before the stooles, when the stocks have cast their last swarmes, *v./* \*v.n./*35./ and also when many meet in one swarme. *v.c./*1.*n/*7. But then, being dead and shrunke together by the force of the poison, they lose much of their stature and comlinesse. 
\3. *The swarme no younger then the stocke./*/ Men thinke that the swarme consisteth onely of young Bees, and that the old Bees only tarrie behinde: but indeed (though it may seeme strange) the swarme is no younger, than the stocke: for there are in both of both sorts. The young Bees remaine in the stock with the old for their defence, and for the greatest labours; *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*57./and the old ones go with the young in the swarme for their aid and guidance in their worke. 
The drones they take with them for propagation of their kinde. *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*3./ \4. *Many drones in a swarme a good signe./*/ And therefore those swarmes that have many Drones will surely prosper: and if they be rathe will swarme againe, unlesse they bee over-hived: whereas those that have few or none, will increase little or nothing all the Summer after. 
\5. *A kinde spring for swarmes./*/ A warme, calme, and showring spring causeth many and

rathe swarmes, though sudden stormes doe hinder them. *v./* \*V.c./*7.*n./*60./
*Augent mella siccitates, sobolem imbres./* \Hist.l.4.c.22./
+Dry weather makes plenty of hony, and + moist of swarms. But note that the chiefe time for breeding swarmes is the Spring, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*13./ and for honie-gathering the Summer: *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*38.39.*&c./*/ so that when a dry Summer followeth a moist Spring, the Bee-folds are rich. If the Summer be also moist, the increase of Bees will be greater: but, because of the scarcity of hony, this increase will proove a decrease: the more swarmes you have at the end of this Summer, the fewer stalls shall you have at the beginning of the next. For, except some faire rathe swarmes, and some good stockes, which cast betimes or not at all, they die all for hunger; when they have spent their own pittance, and spoiled their fellowes. How to prevent this poverty, see *note/* 11.&+ in 20. and to prevent the losse & spoile that would come thereof, take the light stocks, together with the small and late swarmes, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.&iii.&iiii.*in n./*3./ feed the midling sort, *v./* \*V.c./*8.*n./*5./ and be sure they be not over-hived.*v.n./*45.
+The reason is, that in hot and drie weather the hony dewes are raised, and the adventitious moisture is drained from the flowers, the pure naturall juice onely being leaft in them: of both which they gather all the day long without interruption.  
+The reason is, that the weather keeping them in, they can doe nothing but breed and hatch their schadons: and when they goe abroad, they bring in grosse Bee meat, *Ambrosia/* and water, wherewith to feed them; but can finde nothing fit to lay up in store. So that moist weather gives them two causes of swarming, plenty of Bees, and penury of hony: the one makes them able, the other willing: and then neither winde, nor cloud, nor raine can stay them. Whereas in times of plenty it is other-wise. *v.n./*20.
\6. *Swarming weather./*/ Likewise, in warme and calme weather the swarmes delight to arise, but specially in a heat-gleame, after that a showre or gloomie cloud hath sent them home together: in extreme hot and dry weather not so: *v/* \*V.n./*20/ in so much that stalls being full and ready to swarme with the first, are sometime so kept backe with cold dry windes in *Gemini,/* and with extreme heat and drought in *Cancer,/* that they have not swarmed at ali that yeere.
\7 *The swarming houres./*/The swarmes use to come forth betweene the houres of 
[cw: nine]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

nine and three, and sometime an houre sooner or later: but chiefly betweene eleven and one. They choose rather the fore-noone, if the weather please them: otherwise they will stay for a faire houre in the after-noone. This time of the day therefore, in the swarming months, your Bees must continually be attended.
\8. *The two swarming moneths./*/ The swarming moneths are two, *Gemini/* and *Cancer/*: one moneth before the longest day, and an other after. 
In some very backward yeres, such as was 1621.& 1622. there have bin swarmes a weeke in *Leo/*, which did well, (the Bramble, that was wont to be a fortnight or three weekes rather, *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*39./ not blowing before that time:) Likewise in warme Countries in a kinde Spring, some have come somewhat before *Gemini/*, but this also is rare.
\9. *Rathe swarmes./*/ Those that come before the Solstice, in the ascending of the Sunne, are rathe swarmes. 
\10. *Late swarmes./*/ Those that come after, in his descending, are late swarmes. But there are few that come in the first fortnight, and they very good: few also in the last fortnight, namely after *S. Peters/*-tide, and they all as bad: unlesse the backwardnesse of the yeere, when it happeneth, doe mend them. 
Note heere that in the Heath-countrie, swarmes are usually lateward, namely in the latter part of *Cancer/* and the forepart of *Leo:/* which some yeeres prove better then the rathe. 
Those that swarme before the blowing of knap-weed, come in very good time, before the blowing of blackberies, *v./* \*V.c.6.n.39./*/ they may live and doe well, but blackbery-swarmes, specially castlings, are seldome to be kept, as being more likely to die then to live: and if they live, they seldome swarme the next yeere. \11. *Blacke-berie-swarmes are seldome to be kept./*/ And moreover they weaken the stocks from whence they came, which otherwise would swarme betime: and then one such swarme is worth three of those lateward ones. Wherefore put such backe againe into the stocke: which you may easily doe, so soone as they are hived, by knocking them downe upon a table close to the doore: their fellowes that are behinde will soone be in with them. And if they rise againe, serve them so till they cease. But if you spie them rising before the Queene be come forth; shut them in a while, and that will stay them.

\12. *A prime swarme and an after-Swarme./*/ A good stocke doth naturally and usually cast twise; a prime swarme, and an after-swarme: specially if the prime swarme be so rathe, that the castling may come before the bramble-buds be open: yea and rathe prime swarmes not over-hived, \13. *A stall may cast foure times./*/in a plentifull yeere may swarme once or twice: although some full stalls doe not cast once, some but once, and some having many princes (specially when the prime-swarm is broken) doe cast three or foure times. \14. *Divers causes of breaking the prime swarme./*/ For sometime it happeneth that, in the swarming, a blacke cloud rising stayeth part of them that are alreadie come forth, and lie about the hives-doore: sometime when they are all up, either fearing a cloud, or disliking the lighting-place, or being troubled in the hiving, part doth returne.
\15. *One prime-Swarme is worth two after-Swarmes./*/ One prime-swarme is worth two or three after-swarmes, except it be broken: and then if the residue come forth in one entire swarme, that after-swarme may bee the better of the twaine: but if it be divided into two or three, then will they all be but indifferent: such, except they be timely, or united, *v./* \*V.n./*67.&68./ can hardly live till the next Summer.  
\16. *The vulgar Bees appoint the rising of the fore-Swarmes, & that upon 4. grounds./*/ The choice of the time when the first colonies, or prime-swarmes shall goe forth, the rulers referre unto the commons: who by reason of their continuall travell and businesse both without and within, doe best knowe when all things are readie and fit for them: First within they will be sure that they have a Prince ready to goe with them: for without a Governour they will not be, *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*6.&7./. Then that their Hive be full, so that it may be divided at the least into two or three sufficient companies: one to remaine with *Marpesia/* the old Queene, an other to go forth with *Antiope/* the Prince, and a third haplie, which, together with the unripe brood in the celles, maie make an other swarme to serve *Orythia/*. Without likewise they will see, first that the flowers be in state presentlie to furnish them with store of wax and hony: then that the weather do please them, as being warme and calme, & moist: unlesse, being continually unseasonable, they have no choice. *v./*+.*in n./*5. 
\17. *Five signes of the first swarming./*/ When the Hives begin to be full, they will dronie, or yeeld forth fledge-drones: *v./* which is a signe that the first 
[cw: brood]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

brood of nymphes have beene a good while flying abroad, and are now able to endure both weather and labour. 
Other signes of the Hives fulnesse and readinesse to swarm are at the Hive-doore, First, the Bees hovering in cold evenings and mornings. Secondly, the moistnesse or sweating upon the stoole. Thirdly, their hasty running up & downe. Fourthly, their first lying forth in foggy and sultrie mornings & evenings, & going in again when the aire is cleere. 
\18. *The signes of present swarming./*/ When they will swarme, sometime they first gather together without at the doore, not onely upon the Hive, but upon the stoole also: where when you see them begin to hang one upon another in swarming time, and not before, and to grow into a Cluster that covereth the stoole in any place; (specially if there be Drones among them) then be sure they will presently rise, if the weather hold. The first that come forth wil increse that Cluster to some fourth part of the swarme: and then begin they to flie away, first out of the Hive, and after from the Cluster. But commonly some few of them doe first flie forth and play to & fro the Hive-doore, so to till out more company unto them: and when by this meanes they have gotten out so many, that you may see them begin to dance *v/* \*v.n./*34./ above the Hive; then doe they hastilie issue forth and swarme.
But heere you must note, that as to fill the Doore, or to lie forth a little now and then in foggie or sultrie mornings and evenings, (which is because then they are most offended by heat within, and can best indure the aire abroad) and otherwise to go in againe, is a signe that the Hive is full, and therefore ready to swarme; \19. *To lie forth continually is a signe they will not swarme./*/ so to lie forth continually (as in extreme hot and and dry summers they use to doe) under the stock or behind the hive &c. (specially after *Cancer/* is come in) is a signe and cause of not swarming. For the Bees, knowing by nature that the greatest companies doe prosper best, until they finde themselves so pestred with heate and throng of multitudes, that the Hive can scarce hold any more, will have no mind to swarme: and when they have once taken to lie forth, the hive will alwaies seem empty, as though they wanted company. 
\20. *The causes of their lying forth./*/ One cause of their lying forth, us stormie and windie wea-
[cw: ther]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

ther, not suffering them to swarme when they are ready: for when their number is growne so great through their continuall breeding, that the Hive cannot hold them, seeing they may not swarme, they must needs, for want of aire & roome within, lie without: which when they have once caught, they will hardlie leave: and the longer they lie out, the lother they are to swarme. 
An other cause of their lying forth, is continuall hot and drie weather, specially after the Solstice: which causing plentie of hony both in plants and dewes, their mindes are so set upon that their chiefe delight;
*(Tantus amor florum, & generandi gloria mellis)/* \*Virg./*/ that they have no leisure to swarme: although they might most safelie come abroad in such weather, which would not suffer the weakest Nymph to fall.
And when by continuance of such honie-weather they are once sufficientlie provided, they will then be loth to leave the sweet fruits of their labours, and to change their full store-houses for that which makes giddie House-wives. But if they have once begun a combe without where they lie, the matter is out of doubt. Whereas contrarily in wet and scanty Summers, no weather will stay them from swarming as soone as they are readie: although by that meanes (unlesse they be rathe, or the weather sodainelie mend) most as well of the stockes as swarmes are like to die for hunger: *v./* \*V.n.5./*/ and therefore, as neere as you can, so + order the matter, that your swarmes may come betime. For rathe swarmes and their stocks, that have the summer before them, prove alwaies good.
\21. *The remedy and meanes to make them swarme./*/ First keep the Hive as cool as may be, by watering and shadowing both it, and the place where it standeth: and then enlarging the doore to give them aire (alwaies provided that there be no backe-doore in the shadie parts of the Hive) move the cluster gentlie with your Brush, and drive them in. 
If they lie forth and swarme not; (though they have had fit weather two or three daies) then the next calme and warme day, betweene 11. and 1. of the clocke, or within an houre sooner or later, (when the Sunne shineth, and you see 
[cw: no]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

no clouds comming to hide it) put in the better part, at the least, of them that lie out, with your Brush; and the rest gentlie sweep away from the stoole, not suffering any to cluster againe. These rising in the calme heat of the Sunne, and flying about before the Hive, will make such a noyse, as if they were swarming: which their fellowes hearing, will happlie come forth unto them, and so begin to swarme. 
If this doe not serve, but that returning to the Hive they lie forth againe, then reare the Hive high enough to let them in, and cloome up the skirts all but the doore.
But if notwithstamding all this they doe not swarme; then assure your selfe that either they have no Prince bred to goe forth with them, or else they are fat and full of honie, which they are resolved not to leave. 
\22. *What is to be done to those that by no means will swarme./*/ And then it be before Mid-*Cancer/* & the hony-weather hold; your best way is to double the stall, by turning the skirt of the Hive upward, and setting a leere prepared Hive fast upon it: into which they will ascend, and worke and breed there as well as in the old. *v/* \*V.n.24./*/ In the end of *Virgo/* drive them all into the new Hive, (which then, if the weather have held good, will be full of wax and hony) and take the olde for your labour. But if Mid-*Cancer/* and the hony-dewes be past, (because they want time and meanes to store the void Hive) let them stand: such a stall will be verie good to be taken; or, being young, to be kept. *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*3./ But first replenish some over-swarmer with his excesse or lying out (specially if you meane to take him) thus.
\23. *How to replenish an over-swarmer./*/When all hope of their swarming is past; in some evening (while is it yet light) holding a Hive under those that lie out, cut them off from the stoole with a+ tight thread: \+Held straight betweene two hands./ and carrying them to an over-swarmer that you would mend, knock them downe on a Table close before his Hive: into which, because they come without a Prince, they are quietly admitted, and quickly united under one common Commander. 
\24. *How to double a stall./*/ The manner of doubling a stall is this: Having first measured the Hive about in the largest place, provide a leere spleeted Hive of the same size and compasse: make ready also two square stickes 13. or 14. inches long; and an inch thicke at one end, and halfe an inch at the other: these two
[cw: sticks]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

sticks lay parallel over the hive five or six inches apart, and each of them a like distance from the middle of the Hive, with both the thicke ends one way to size out the doore for this doubled stall: and so tie them with needle and thread to the skirts fast in their places. These stickes doe also serve to keepe the Hive from slipping, and so save the Bees, that otherwise might be prest to death betweene the two skirts. Then in a faire night, so soon as it is dark, reare the full Hive with three bolsters, two on the West side, and one on the East, some foure or five inches high, (or with a double rest) to let the Bees in: and cover both it and the stoole with a large Mantle. Then make a Brake behinde the stoole of foure stakes, 2. two foot, and 2. foure foot long, pitched fast in distance equall, and fit to conteine the full Hive, being of the same compasse. One of the short stakes set close to the middle of the backe of the stoole, the other Northward opposite to it: one of the long ones on the West part, and the other on the East. Then right in the middle, betweene the stakes, digge a hole in the ground halfe a foot deepe; and of such compasse, that being halfe filled with a wisp of straw, it may fitly receive the top of the Hive, and so the Hive may stand upright and fast in the Brake. Then pare away the inner edges of the tops of the short stakes, and the Hive in the setting downe may not stay against them: and taking up the West-stake, sticke it to you.
These things thus prepared, your selfe standing on the West side of the Brake, and your assistant on the same side of the stoole at your right hand, (both in your complete harnesse) *v:/* let the assistant take hold of the Hive, &, yeelding the top toward his breast, reare the fur-side of the skirt from the East-bolster. When you see it fitting, embracing the hive as neere the skirt as you may, lift it up sheere from the other two bolsters, and set it downe warily in the middle of the Brake, with the top in the hole as upright as you can, and the doore to the backer part of the stoole, that it may stand South-ward as it did before. And presently let your assistant, being readie, place the leere prepared hive even upon it, with the thick ends of the stickes South-ward: and doe

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

you put the long stake into his place againe. Then cloome the Hives together with rolles, flatted, that none of the cloome fall in among the Bees, leaving open the space betweene the sticks ends for the new doore of this double hive. Lastly put on the hackle, and gird both it and the long stakes to the leere-hive, about the middle with a Belt, and about the top with a With. And so let them stand till after the end of the *Dog-daies/*, when Bees are taken. *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*1./ But in no case let the doing hereof be deferred beyond the time prescribed, *v:/* \*V.n.22./*/ lest you have little or nothing for your labour. 
\25. *How to drive all the Bees into the new hive, and so to take the old./*/ At the Vindemie, in a faire calme morning before any Bees be abroad, shut up close all the stalls in your Garden: and those that stand next cover with sheetes and blankets, lest some of the younger sort mistake, and tarrie at their doores till they be chilled. And when the Sunne is an houre high, and the aire waxeth warme, having first parted the new Combs and the old with a long knife, take off the upper hive or *Receiver,/* & set him upon the stoole in the old place: BUT be sure, &c. *as it followeth,/* *c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*15. If you see the *Receiver/* be very fat, or feare the Queene be hurt, or not in the *Receiver/*; your best and safest way is to take them both: for if they be over-fat or want a Ruler, undoubtedly they will not prosper. 
\26. *The signes of after swarmes/*/ The signes of the after-swarmes are more certaine. For whereas the rising of the prime swarme is appointed by the vulgar, whose chiefe rule is the fulnesse of the Hive; the Hive being now well emptied, for other swarmes there needeth some other direction, \27. *The rising of the after-swarmes is appointed by the Rulers./*/ which the Rulers themselves doe give by their voices: without which that stocke will swarme no more that yeare. And yet the choice of the houre, yea and of the day among foure or five is permitted unto them, as best knowing the disposition of the weather. 
\28. *The Bees Musicke./*/ When the prime swarme is gone (if the stocke shall cast any more) the eighth or ninth evening after, sometime the tenth or eleventh, the next Prince, when she perceiveth a competent number to be fledge and readie, beginneth to tune in hir treble voice a mournefull and begging note, as if she did pray hir Queene-mother to let them goe. Unto which voice if the Queene vouchsafe to reply, tuning hir

\29. *The Princes part./*/ This song being contained within the compasse of an *Eight/* from *C-sol-fa-ut/* to *C-sol-fa/*, the Prince composeth hir part within the foure upper Cliefes *G, A, B,/* and *C/* usually in triple moode, beginning with an odde *Minim/* in *G-sol-re-ut/*, and tuning the rest of hir notes, whereof the first is a *Semibriefe/*, in *A-la-mi-re./* Sometime she taketh a higher key, sounding the odde *Minim/* in *A-la-mi-re/*, and the rest in *B-fa-b-mi./* Sometime, specially toward their comming forth, she riseth yet higher to *C-sol-fa/*, holding the time of three or foure *Semibriefes,/* more or lesse. Now and then shee beginneth in duple time some two or three *Semibriefes/*, but alwaies endeth with *Minims/* of the triple Moode.
\30. *The Queenes part./*/ The Queenes part, contained within the foure lower Cliefes, consisteth of *Minims/* altogether in triple moode; commonly in *Fa-fa-ut,/* sometime in *C-sol-fa-ut,/* sometime in the other two *Cliefes/* betweene them: continuing hir tune the time of nine or ten *Semibriefes/* more or lesse.
\31. *The other Ladies parts./*/ Sometime a third Princesse imitating the Queenes voice in time, though differing haply in tune, joyneth with them, the more, with their full noise, to incite the swarme to goe, that hir turne may come the sooner. And sometime a fourth also interposeth hir *Minims/* to fill up the Quire. But none dare counterfeit the voice of the chiefe Prince, for that were treason to hir person (and yet sometime one of them, in hope to part the swarme, will steale out with hir:) which, if the swarme be not parted, or being parted be put together, costeth her hir life *v:/* \*V.c./*1.*n./*7./ as well as the lives of some of hir fol- 
[cw: lowers.]

lowers. Notwithstanding each of these, when hir elder sister is gone, and hir turne next, changeth hir note, begging in *Orithyas/* tune leave to be gone too: which as sometime the Queene granteth unasked, beginning first hir selfe; so sometime by hir silence she denieth, though mournfully intreated: and then the swarme tarieth, and the poore Ladie must die. 
With these various and harmonious notes, answering one an other, and some pawses betweene, they goe solemnly round about the Hive, so to give warning unto all the company. This they continue daily untill their swarming: but you may heare them best evenings and mornings. Which Musicke as it cannot please and delight them that listen to it; so must it be most sweet and pleasant to the young Prince hir selfe, unto whom therby is proclaimed a Warrant, not onely of hir life, but of a Kingdome also: both which otherwise she were sure to lose.
\32. *In the Bees song are the grounds of Musicke./*/ In this *Melissomelos,/* or Bees Madrigall, Musicians may see the grounds of their Art: first their *Moodes/*, sometime the *triple/* or *imperfect/* of the more, sometimes the *duple/* or *imperfect/* of the lesse: then the tunes of the six notes, *ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la/*; whereof the Queene soundeth the first foure, and the Prince the other two, together with the doubling of *fa-sol/* in two higher Cliefes, to make up the full *Eight:/* and lastly the six Concords, an *imperfect Third/*, a *perfect Third/*, a *Diatessaron/*, a *Diapente/*, a *Sixt,/* and a *Diapason/*. And if any man dislike the harshnesse of the *Seconds/* and *Sevenths/*, which now and then hit among them; he sheweth himselfe no experienced Artist, which knoweth not that as well in *Musick/* as *Oeconomick/* there must sometime be Discords: yea and that in either they have had their laudable use, as serving to make sweet Concords the sweeter. So that if *Musicke/* were lost, it might be found with the +*Muses/* Birds. 
The severall parts of whole Song comprizing these mentioned notes, with pauses interposed (as I have at severall times by a Winde-instrument, whose notes can neither rise nor fall, attentively observed) I thought good heere to prick downe, that you may see them in all these particulars of their Naturall Art. Onely I cannot altogether warrant the Conclusion: because in that confused noise, which the buzzing Bees in the busie time of their departing doe make, my dull hearing could not perfectly apprehend it: so that I was faine to make up that, as I could. But I am sure, if I misse, I misse but a little.

\33. *Before swarming the voices come downe to the stoole./*/ In the morning before the swarme come abroad, these Ladies come downe neerer the stoole: and there they hold on their melodie somewhat longer, singing sometimes above twentie notes together, and with shorter pauses.
\34. *The manner of their swarming./*/ At the very swarming time they descend to the stoole: where answering one another in more earnest manner, with thicker & shriller notes, the mainie begins to march along; thronging one another for haste, and buzzing with their winges in great jolitie.
As soone as those gallant Nymphs are aloft, they doe most nimbly bestirre themselves, sporting and playing in and out as if they were dancing the Hey; in this manner waiting for the comming of their Prince. Now when some two third parts or three fourth parts of the swarme is passed, the Musick ceaseth, and +then commeth forth this stately Dame *Orythia/*: who walking a turne or two before the doore (of purpose, you would thinke, to be seene) she takes hir leave, leaving but a small traine to follow her: which high them after as fast as they can. 
+Sometime when ill weather hath kept in the swarme over long, shee will come forth before them, as it were checking their slacknesse and timiditie: but then returning in, she commeth forth afterward in hir due place.
This decent order the great Lords of the earth seeme to have learned of this little Ladie: who in their Country progresses, goings to Parliament, and other solemne processions, doe send the greatest and fairest part of their retinew before them, having behinde but a smale troope of necessarie attendants to gard their persons. 
\35. *The prime swarme being broken, the next may call and swarm within the eighth day./*/ If the prime swarme be broken, the second will both call, and swarme the sooner; it may be the next day: and by that occasion haply a third also may arise, yea and sometime a fourth.
But all within a fortnight after the prime swarme.
\36. *All the swarmes of one hive come within a fortnight./*/ Except in some extraordinarie plentifull yeares both for Breed and Honie. Such was 1616. wherein not onely many swarmes did swarme as old stockes; but also old stockes having betimes swarmed twice, about six weekes after began to swarme a fresh, as in an other yeare: and so had, in effect, two Summers in one. 
[cw: After]

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

After the second swarme, I have heard a young Ladie-bee call: but the Queene, not willing to part with any more of hir companie, did not answer: and the next day she with seven more were brought forth dead. *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*7./
Sometime though the Queene give consent to a third or fourth, the Bees seeing the stock little enough to live, shew themselves loth to goe: and then also there is no way with her, but one. 
\37. *What use there is of tinging the swarme./*/ When the swarme is up, and busie in their dance, *v:/* it is a common use, for want of other Musicke, to play them a fit of mirth with a Pan, Kettle, Bason, Candlesticke, or other like Instrument, so to stay them, forsooth, from flying away. Indeed where other Bee-folds are not farre off, this use hath a good use: for thereby the place and time of their rising is publikely notified, and so a just and open claime laid unto the Swarme, that otherwise some false neighbour might challenge for his: which undoubtedly was the originall cause of this custome. But the pretended reason is to me a meere fancie: although I know it to bee as ancient as common. For *Claudian/* long agoe could say, 
*-------------Cybeleia quassans
Hiblæus procul æra senex revocare fugaces
Tinnitu conatur apes.------------/* \De 6.consolatu.Honorii./
And before him *Virgil,/*
*Hinc ubi jam emissum cave is ad sidera cœti
Nare per æstatem liquidam suspexeris agmen, &c.
Tinnitusque cie, & matris quate cymbala circum:
Ipsæ confident medicatis sedibus, ipsæ
Intmia more suo sese in cunabula condent./* \Georg.4./
And before him old *Aristotle/*,
*Gaudere etiam plausu, & sonitu apes videntur. Quapropter tinnitu æris aut Fictilis convocari eas in alveum aiunt. 
 
\38. *What to doe if a swarme be way-ward./*/ If you see them begin to flie aloft (which is a token they would be gone) cast dust among them to make them come downe. If they be not stayed, but, hasting on still, goe beyond your bounds; the ancient Law of Christendome 
[permitteth]

permitteth you to pursue them withersoever, for the recoverie of your owne.

But sometime they flye so fast and so farre before they pitch, that though you follow them never so fast, you must be content to leave them, happily to the happy finder. For when you have lost the sight and hearing of them, you have lost al right and propertie in them. 
*Examen ex alveo tuo evolaverit, eousque intellegitur esse tuum, donec in conspectu tuo est, nec difficilis persecutio eius est: alioquin occupantis est./* Justinian.l.2.institutionum juris tit.de rerum divisione./*
\39. *Some swarmes provide them houses aforehand./*/ Sometime they wil be provided of a house before they swarme, which some Harbingers have found and viewed, and dressed against their comming: as either a hollow tree, or a void Hive: and then will they away presently, and by no meanes settle till they come thither. \40. *And then they fly away directly to the place./*/ Unto which place they will flie, not, as at other times, uncertainely this way and that way: but as directly as they can guesse. 
A poore Woman having taken a poore swarme to keepe for halfe, by New-yeares-tide lost hir owne part and hir Partners: and being carelesse of the Hive when the Bees were dead, she let it stand abroad till she had forgotten it: The next Summer comming into hir Garden, she found some Bees passing to and fro hir Hive, which were then busie in clensing and dressing it: she wisely fearing that the Bees came to carrie away the Wax that was leaft, bade hir Daughter take the Hive and carrie it in: The Wench following hir play did happily forget hir mothers command: and by that meanes the Hive stood still, till the unexpected swarme came, that afterward stored hir garden. It is not amisse therefore to follow the counsell of *Columella:/* \41. *Vacua alvearia stent semper parata in Apiario./*/ *Oportet autem vacua domicilia collocata in apiarijs habere. Nam sunt nonnulla examina quæ cum processerint, statim sedem sibi quærant in proximo (Seu potius prius quæsitam, lustratam, & paratam ad eant.v.n.39.) eandemque occupent quam vacuam reperint./*

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

\42. *The Hiving of Bees./*/ {W}Hen your swarme hath made choice of a lighting place, you shall quickly see it knit together in forme (if nothing let) of a +Cone, Pine-aple, or cluster of grapes. As soone as it is setled, or at least as sone after as may be, hive them. \43. *When they are to be hived./*/ For the longer they hang, the lother they are to be put from the place, the more time they lose from their worke, and the more in danger are they to be gone, either home againe, or quite away. \+A Cone is a round *Pyramis. Figura rotunda ex lato in acutu definens:/* and therefore is a Pine-aple, of his figure, called *Conus./*/ 
For when they are once setled, they presently send forth spies, to search out an abiding place: who if they returne with good newes before swarming-time be past that day, they rise presently, and are gone: otherwise they will stay till swarming-time the next day. \44. *The token of their flying away after they be setled./*/ But whensoever the spies have sped, they returne with all speed, and no sooner doe they touch the Cone or Cluster, but they begin to shake their wings like as the Bees doe that are chilled: which the next perceiving doe the like: and so doth this soft shivering passe as a watch-word from one to an other, untill it come to the inmost Bees: whereby is caused a great hollownesse in the Cone. When you see them doe thus, then may you bid them farewell: for presently they begin to unknit, and to be gone. And then though you Hive them never so well, they will not abide. 
\45. *How to fit the Hives to the swarmes./*/ When you see your swarme, first choose out a fit hive, neither too big nor too little, but proportionable to the quantitie and time of the swarme: so that the Bees may fill it that yeere, or the least within a handfull, which they may make up the next yeere in good time.
A swarme before *Mid-gemini,/* put into a Hive that conteineth twice so much as the +swarme is: A swarm at *Cancer,/* into a Hive that conteineth so much, and halfe so much: and for a swarme at *Mid-cancer,/* a Hive, that will hold it or little more, may suffice. The rest betweene these let be fitted in like proportion unto these. 
For example, a swarme of three gawns, of a +good Prime-swarme before *Mid-Gemini/*, will aske a Hive of three pecks: such a one at *Cancer/*, a Hive of five gawnes. Likewise a double-prime swarme comming betime, is fitted with a bushell-Hive: and all pecke-swarmes, and other single 
[cw: swarmes]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

swarmes after *Mid-Cancer/*, with the least, or halfe-bushell-hive, *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*6./ But little and late swarmes are rather to be united.*v./* \*V.n./*67.&63./

+The aire being sultry-hot, causeth the swarme to hang hollow, and so to seeme greater than he is. 
+The goodnesse or greatnesse of a swarme you may most certainelie know by the weight: it being a good one that weigheth five pound, a reasonable good one that weigheth foure, and a very good one that weigheth six. Hereby also it will not be difficult, which seemeth impossible, to know what number of Bees is in a swarme; if you know first that 4480.is a pound, because 280. weigheth one ounce, as 35. one dragme. So that two good swarmes united weighing 10.or 11. pound, doe conteine betweene 40. and 50. M, the number of a Campe Royall: which company cannot wel be larger under one Leader, in the largest Hive.*v.c./*3.*n./*6. Of such a number did *Alexanders/* victorious Army consist. For *Diod.Sic.l./*17. reckoneth up some 48.M. with those 13500. leaft behind with *Antipater./* And *Justin.l.9./* not mentioning this company, numbreth 36500. which number is also great enough for a very faire swarm; as conteining the quantity of two reasonable swarmes united: there being also few single swarms so good, as to amount to 30000. 
The weight of any swarme is to be knowne when the Bees are newly hived, and the number in any weight when they are newly taken.

If this just proportion be not precisely kept, the Bees may doe well enough in a middle-sized hive: for being under-hived, they will cast somewhat the sooner, though peradventure the lesse swarme in good time; and being but a little over-hived, though they spend some time in supplying the former yeeres defects, they may yet swarme in good time, and the fairer swarme. And indeed all swarmes, whether bigger or lesse, by decreasing or increasing, doe naturally draw towards this quantity. 
But if the disproportion be much, it must be amended; whether you spy your error the same day, or afterward. 
If the same day, your remedy is to knocke out the Bees upon the mantle betweene two single Rests, and to set a fitter Hive over them: but this is not to be done before the swarming-houres be past, lest some of the Bees take a miffe and goe home againe. Otherwise you may set the Hive in a Brake, *v./* \*V.n.24./*/ with his bottome upward, and the fitter Hive upon.
If afterward you see the Bees lying out, that they are 
[cw: under-]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

under-hived, your remedy is to reare the Hive with a skirt, or Bolsters, as much as will let them in. If at *Virgo/* you see, by their not filling the Hive, that they are over-hived; your remedie is then to cut off the skirt unto the combes, or neere to them.
\46. *Better to under-hive a stall then to over-hive him./*/
But generally it is safer and more for your profit, to under-hive a swarme, than to over-hive him.
\47. *Three things requisite to hiving/*/ Your Hive being fitted and dressed, *v./* \*v.c./*3.*n./*8./ you must have also in readinesse a Mantle, a Rest, and a Brush.
The Mantle may be a sheet, or halfe-sheet, or some other linnen cloth, an ell square at the least. 
A Rest is either single or double. The single Rest is a *Prisme/* or three square *Columne/*, eighteene inches long, and three inches deepe, having the upper edge full of nicks for the space of six inches at each end, and the middle space, of six inches, smooth. It will be safer for the Bees, and lighter for cariage, if the length of tenne inches in the middle of the bottome be cut away one inch high, abating the new edges; and the foure inches at each end be hollowed in the middle of the bottome from end to end, at the same height of one inch: an so this will be the forme of the side, 

{diagram}

And this of the end. It is most fitlie made of a quarter of a young tree. {diagram}

Upon shelving or hanging ground, one single Rest may serve: but if the ground be somewhat levell, it is better to use two: because the Hive-skirt is set down upon them with lesse danger to the Bees, then upon the ground or other flat thing. And these two Rests are to be placed with the upper edges about nine inches apart: so that the Hive standing upon them, may hang out over them some two or three inches 
[cw: In]

===  
 
$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

In some cases two single Rests are most convenient, *v./* \*V.n./*45.56.69./ but in most the double: *v/* \*V.n./*57./ which is also lighter for carriage, and more ready for use. 
\50. *The double Rest./*/ The double Rest consisteth of two parts or sides, an inch thicke, of the same length and depth with the single Rest, having such upper edges so nickt at both ends, and the lower edges smooth, with ten inches of the middle cut away halfe an inch high, and then made sharpe againe which two sides are to be fastned one to another, at the just distance of nine inches from edge to edge, with two Rounds or Braces tennanted into them three or foure inches from the ends. These sides are fitly made of inch-board, or of a cleaft Lug of Withie or other wood. 
\51. *The Brush./*/ The Brush is a handfull of Rosemary, Hyssop, Fennell, or other herbes; of Hazell, Withie, Plum-tree, or other boughs; or rather of boughes with hearbs, bound taper-wise together. 
\52. *What the Hiver must doe./*/ All things necessary thus prepared, let the Hiver, which must weare no offensive apparell, *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*27./ first drinke of the best beere, and wet his hands and face therewith: and then let him goe about his businesse soberly and gently, taking good heed where he sets his foot, and how hee handleth them: for if he tread upon a Bee, or by any other meanes crush one of them; they presently finding it, by the ranke smell of the poysonous humor, will be so angry; that he shall have worke enough to defend himselfe, unlesse he have on his complete harnesse: *v/* \*v.c./*1.*.n/*40./ and being thus disquieted they will be the worse to hive. Moreover, the troubling of them doth oft times make them rise and goe home againe: sometime it breaketh the swarme, causing part to returne, whereby the rest are discouraged, being least unsufficient: yea somtime it disperseth and spoyleth the whole swarme: it may be also the death of the Queene: and then they will not continue to the next Summer, howsoever provided. And experience hath taught me, that few swarmes much troubled in the hiving do prosper. And therefore in any case Hive them as quietly, and with as little businesse as you may. 
\53. *The manner of Hiving./*/ The manner of hiving is so manifold, by reason of the 
[cw: many]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

many & different circumstances of the lighting or pitching places, that it can hardly be taught by precepts; but is rather to be learned by use and experience, guided with reason and discretion. Neverthelesse for the helpe of novices, I will set downe some speciall directions, which he that marketh, may readily hive a swarme in most lighting places: and a little practise will fit him for any.
\54. *Foure meanes of Hiving a Swarme./*/ First therefore note that a swarme is to be hived by 1.shaking, or 2.cutting the bough whereon it hangeth, or by 3.wiping the Bees down, or 4.driving them up into the Hive. 
\55. *How to Hive a Swarme that lighteth upon a bough./*/ If your swarme lighteth upon a bough; first spread the Mantle under it, and lay the Rest or Rests in the middle thereof, with the ends toward two corners of the Mantle. 
\56. *Either high./*/
Then if the swarme be so high, that you or some assistant may conveniently put the Hive under it; having first removed the twigs round about, that stand in your way, shake the Bees into the Hive: and when you have set the Hive right upon the Rests, take up two corners of the Mantle at the ends of the Rests, and pinne them together upon the top of the Hive, to stay the Bees running out sodainely: and then returning to the bough, shake it againe, and turne it aside out of his place, or cover it with your body, or with some cloth: and then presently loose the corners of the Mantle, and spread them againe. When they begin to cease running into the Hive, if you see them lie thicke upon the Mantle, shake them to the Hive-skirts: and the rest, as well upon the Hive as the Mantle, drive in gently with your Brush. So shall you easily and quietly Hive them. Otherwise having first taken away the twigs that may let you, cut off the bough or boughes (for sometime they wil hang upon many): and if you doubt that some of them may fall in the cutting, let another second you with the ready Hive, holding it directly under them. The bough being cut, lay the *Cone/* betweene two single Rests, and set the Hive over them. Or else put the *Cone/* first in the Hive, and then set the Hive downe upon the Rests. 
\57. *Or low./*/
But if they hang so neere the ground, that you cannot conveniently put the Hive under them; then placing the 
[cw: Mantle]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

Mantle and Rests right under, shake them downe: and setting the Hive over them upon the Rests, take up the two corners of the Mantle, and doe as before. 
And in case some of the swarme be first fallen to the ground, whence they make no haste to rise againe; then, placing a double Rest without a Mantle as well as you may, not killing any Bees, either shake the rest downe to them, and so set the Hive over them all, or else set the Hive over that part, and the rest, having cut the bough, lay beside the Hive, and move them with your Brush. 
\58. *How if it light upon a high tree./*/ If they pitch upon a high tree, it is best not to shake them into the Hive, but rather with a sharpe knife cut the bough if you can conveniently: and either put it into the Hive, and cover it with a Mantle, or bring it downe gentlie in you hand. But if you want a ladder or other meanes to bring it downe, then let it downe by a cord tied to some crooke of the bough. 
\59. *How if upon the body of a tree./*/ If they pitch upon the body of a tree, or upon some great arme; then set one side of the Hive right over the Bees, and with the Brush drive them up by moving still the lower and wayward part. But if you have no meanes to fasten the Hive by tying it above, or propping it beneath with prongs or the like, or if they be unwilling thus to take the Hive;  then parting them from the tree with a tight *v./* \*V.n./*23./ thred, wipe them downe into the hive, and set them upon the Mantle & Rest under the tree. IF they be so high that you must clime for them, then cover them presently with a Mantle, and so carry them downe. But looke that many will rise againe: which let alone untill they be knit, and then sweepe them likewise into another leere Hive, and put them to their fellowes. If yet some of them will up againe, you must not cease to trouble them, by wiping them off gently with your Brush, by laying on Mug-wort, Margerom, Wormewood, +Archangell, \+*White Nettle./*/ or other Weeds, or Hearbs, or by covering the place with a cloth: and after a while they will all to their fellowes in the Hive. 
But if they be so neere to the ground, that you cannot conveniently put the Hive under them; then with a tight thred 
[cw: sweep]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

sweep them downe upon the ground, having first layed the Rest either with or without the Mantle, and set the Hive over them.
And if they be of that distance from the ground, that you may set a stoole close under them; then make fast one side of the Mantle unto the tree close under the Bees, and the rest of the Mantle lay upon the stoole with the Rest: then having sodainly swept downe the Bees upon the Mantle, set the hive over them: and presently loosing that side of the Mantle from the tree, lay it over the Bees close to the Hive. 
\60. *How if it light upon the top of any thing./*/ If they light on the top of a stub, pollard, dead hedge, or the like, set one side of the Hive over them, propping the other side with a prong or two, and drive them up as before. 
\61. *How if it light in the middle of a dead hedge./*/ If they light in the middle or bottome of a dead hedge, your best way is softly to unworke the hedge till you come to them: otherwise you must violently knocke the hedge on the other side, so forcing the Bees into the Hive: and then setting them downe, trouble the place as before. But then be sure to be troubled your selfe: for it is hard to get them from such a hold. 
\62. *How if it light on some hollow side of a stub, or tree./*/ If they light on some hollow side of a stub or tree, which they wil be loth to leave; beware in any case you wet them not: for that doth not onely drowne many, but also maketh the rest more eagerly keepe the place: because some through the wet cannot flie away, and their fellowes finding them there will still resort unto them. But when you have moved them by other meanes as much as you may, put some morter or cloome in the hollow place, moving it forward by little and little so that you burie none of the Bees, untill you have spread it over the place: and then they will forsake that, and take some other part of the tree or stub, where you may more easily hive them. 
\63. *How if it flie into a hollow tree./*/ When they flie into a hollow tree, so that by none of the foresaid meanes you can hive them, then must you remove them by some offensive smoake, and make them chuse a new lighting place: which is thus to be done. If the Bees lye above the hole where they went in (as they will doe if they may) then boare a hole above them: if beneath, beneath 
[cw: them:]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

them: but be sure that the upper hole bee wide enough: rather than faile make two or three with a two-inch auger, or, with a hatchet, one as great. Then fire a peece of Match, or for want of Match, take a little Hay, or other thing that will smoake moderately, and not flame; and put it into the tree beneath them: and you shall see them fly forth above for life, and presently pitch in some place where you may hive them. But this is to be done the same or the next day at the farthest: for afterward they will abide the smother, and rather lose their lives then leave their goods. 
\64. *How if it light upon another hive./*/ If a swarme by reason of the coldnesse of the aire, and roughnesse of the wind being not able to get away, do offer to light upon any other Hive; quickly cover the Hive close with a Mantle, lest the Bees entring be pittifully murdered. 
\65. *The swarme is alwaies to be kept together, lest the Bees kill one another./*/ But in all manner hivings this one rule is generall. The swarme must bee continually kept together: for if at that time part remaine from the company but the space of halfe an houre or lesse; afterward when they finde them, and would returne unto them, they are used as Strangers and Robbers: as fast as they come they are beaten and killed. And those that escaping thence goe back to their old home, finde no better entertainment: and those few that escape thence, desperately runne into any other Hives, and so leape out of the Frying-pan into the fire. And therefore when the swarme is hived, if you see part begin to gather together by themselves; remove them as speedily as you can, that they may goe to their fellowes in time. 
\66. *The swarme to be set neer the lighting-place./*/And alwaies if you may chuse, set the swarme in the morning Sunne, and as neere the lighting-place as may be: which if some inconvenience will not suffer you to doe, yet set it within the length of a Pearch, or at the least within sight and hearing: and then (lest those which are leaft at the lighting place, by losing their company a while, lose their lives also) first trouble them by the meanes mentioned. *n./*59. and then cause some of the hived part to arise by shaking them off the bough, and by wiping them downe that are on the out-side of the Hive. Which, when they are up, will make such a noise, that their fellowes may easily finde them. And 
[cw: if]

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$
if any yet hankering behinde chance to be set upon when they come to the Hive, be-sprinkle the Mantle, the Hive, and the Bees with a little strong drinke, and you shall part the fray. 
And if any man marvaile why they of the same swarme shoulde so soone be strange one to another, seeing that Bees of one Hive being pent a whole day in an other, are yet welcome to their fellowes at the last; I can give no other reason but this, that they knowing a swarme may part, and so each part become a severall company, they deeme these to be such by their long absence. And if you aske why they should finde so hard entertainment in their old home from whence they came, it is because they went away with a Leader of their owne, and so became a severall company. And therefore if she bide away, as many as come backe (unlesse they come presently) are used as strangers: but if part have brought hir home againe, the rest do safely returne afterward, either that evening, or the next morrow.
\67. *What to doe if a swarme part./*/ If the swarme part, as sometime it will, and settle in divers places so neere that they may see each other; let the greatest part alone, specially if it bee best to hive, and trouble the other in the setling with shaking, gentle rubbing with weeds, and spitting and blowing in the place, that they may goe to their fellowes. If they bee setled and hang upon a bough, cut the bough and bring them to them. If they bee setled in some other place, then put them in a hive without Spleets: and if they bee within a pearch of the other part, move them both, one towards an other by little and little they be close together. After they have stood so about halfe an houre, lift up the spleeted hive from his Mantle and Rest, and shake the Bees out of the unspleeted hive upon the same: you may first knocke the hive downe, and then presently clap it twise or thrice betweene your hands. This done, sprinkle both parts with good drinke, and then without any stay set the spleeted hive over them, and they wil straight way up into it. But lay the unspleeted hive along hard by, not where it stood, but on the other side: and those that remaine in it will follow their fellows. But if the parts 
[cw: be]

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

be farther a-part then a Pearch; then put them together the same night, as if they were two swarmes. *v.n.69./* 
In like manner, when you have little swarmes under the quantitie of a Pecke, specially after *Cancer/* is well entred; put two or three of+ them together, whether they rise in the same day, or in divers. 
+After this time, the chiefe breeding being past, the swarmes desire most to unite themselves, that thereby they may make their company sufficient: which by breeding they have not time to doe. 
\68. *Uniting of swarmes is profitable./*/ For being thus united they will labour cheerefully, gather store of wealth, and stoutly defend themselves against all enemies: whereas if they were kept asunder, they would surely perish the next robbing-time, or winter; or hiving would doe you little good. And therefore if two swarmes rising at the same time do weld and knit togither; (as lightly they will doe, if they be within hearing one of an other) never trouble your selfe to part them, nor to be sorrie for the chance. For those two being all one, are better then three such that are alone. Indeed sometime it falleth out, that they fall out, and fight at the first: but that is because they are yet divers companies under divers Commanders. For so soone as the inferior being taken away, there remaineth one supreme Monarch over all; the strife presently ceaseth, and they are thence-forth linked in perpetuall peace and unitie together. Wherefore they are little acquainted with the nature of these politike creatures, that fetch their similitudes from them, to crosse that Rich, Mighty, Renowmed, thrice happy UNION, under one Prudent, Potent, Peacefull, thrice Noble Souveraigne.
\69. *The manner of uniting./*/ The way to unite two swarmes is this. In the evening some two or three houres after Sunne-set, or when it waxeth darke, having spread a Mantle on the ground, neere unto the stoole, where this united swarme shall stand, and set a paire of Rests in the middle of it; knock downe the *Remover/* upon the Rests, and then lifting up the Hive a little, and clapping it betweene your hands to get out the Bees that sticke in it, lay it downe on his side warily by the Bees, and set the 
[cw: *Receiver/*] 

===

=== 

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

*Receiver/* upon the Rests over them: and they will begin presently to ascend. If those that remaine doe not runne out to their company, of their owne accord; clap the place where they be gathered, and force them out: and lay downe the hive againe so, that the small remnant may follow their fellowes: if you spy any clustering by themselves, or stragling from the Rests, guide them thither. And when they are all in, either that night, or betimes in the morning, cloome the Hive unto his stoole. 
\70. *Another way./*/ Otherwise about ten a clocke, or as soone as it is darke, soe the *Remover/* in a Brake *v:/* \*V.n.24./*/ with his bottome upward, and the *Receiver/* upon him, binding them about the skirts with a long Towell or two Napkins sowed or pinned together, and so let them stand till the morning: and then set the *Receiver/* upon his stoole. After this manner I united two swarmes without death of any one Bee, saving onely her that must not be saved. 
If there be not Bees enough in the Hive, you may in like manner put another swarme to them.
\71. *Two speciall inconveniences to be avoided in this worke./*/ In the uniting of swarmes, two speciall inconveniences are to be avoided. The one that being united, they exceed not the naturall quantitie of a swarme: *v./* for if they doe, though they agree and gather, and grow fat, yea and cast the next yeare a faire swarme; yet will they never come to their first quantitie againe, nor scarse swarme any more in that vast roome. The other that they fight not, and destroy one an other. \72. * 1.Superfluous multitude./*/ \*V.c./*3.*n./*6./ \73. 2.*Civill warre./*/ Unto which two inconveniences the swarmes that unite themselves, if they be not aided, are obnoxious. \74. *To prevent the first./*/ To prevent the fruitlesse concourse of more then need is, which is the first inconvenience, when you see a sufficient faire swarme abroad, have an eye unto the rest of your stockes: if you espie an other about to rise, stay him by present shutting the doore with a Napkin, Apron, or other such cloth, untill the first swarme be setled: if then one rising draw neere unto him (as lightly he will doe if he can finde him) cover him quickly with a Mantle till that be setled: if being now hived, an other presse into him; then before many be entred, (that you may be sure not to have the Queene) 
[cw: carrie]

===

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

carrie away the Hive with the swarme about two pearches off: and set a leere prepared Hive in his place for that other swarme. 
If none of these things bee done, but that swarmes doe runne together in greater quantitie than a good Hive can conteine; then reare the Hive with bolsters high enough to let them all in: which, when they have once swarmed, the +next Vindemie take away thus. 
+If you doe it in Winter, see the Bees be not chilled.
In a faire afternoone, about foure a clocke, picke away all the cloome betweene the hive and the stoole: and in the morning, at the breake of the day, lay the Hive along with the edges of the Combes up and downe, upon a Mantle spread on the ground: and there pare off the Combes ends even with the skirts, and so set him againe on the Stoole upon moveable *v:/* \*V.c./*3.*n./*29./ Doore-posts, and a thin bolster behinde: and presently clome up the Hive as close as may be. 
\75 *To prevent the second/*/ Concerning the other inconvenience, know this, that though two strange swarmes, with their severall Queenes, doe never meet in one Hive without discontent; (which they expresse by running to and fro without, and making a tumultuous noise within: from which they sometime fall to fighting and killing) yet commonly this strife is soone at an end. For the first Queene having gotten the right of the whole Roome by the possession of the Capitol or Superior part, where she sitteth safe with hir Guard about her; the Inferior by a common consent, is straight-way dispatched: and so they become all fellowes and friends under one Soveraigne. And therefore when swarmes are united by you, be sure that the Bees in the *Receiver/* be not throwne downe among the other, lest the Superior Queene come downe with them, and so you make more strife than needs.
\76. *When most danger./*/ But the danger is when two Princes with their equall Colonies happen to be equally advanced in the Hive: and therefore neither yeeldeth to other, but fight it out on both sides with equall hope of victorie. When this chanceth, which is very seldome, the Controversie is doubtfull; and the conflict like to be perillous, or rather pernicious, if it be

not prevented. In this case you have no other way, but the next morning, if still they fight, to cast them all out of the Hive: and so will they either knit apart, or returne to their old stockes: from whence another time they may swarme more luckily. The six and twentieth of June, 1621. \77. *A storie of a deadly feud./*/ I had two faire swarmes up at once, which going together over-filled a good Hive: where neither of them yeelding their Queene to the other, the fight continued full two daies and two nights, even from Thursday noone till Saturday in the afternoone: wherein such havock was made, that the better part of these brave Souldiers (a mournfull spectacle) lay some dead, some halfe-dead sprawling on the ground. At the last it was my hap to spie one of these Queenes at the Hive skirts in a Cluster: which taking up, now, quoth I to one that stood by me, heere is shee for whose sake all this slaughter was made: about an houre after my sonne found the other dead on the ground. When they had thus mercilessly murdered both the Queenes, and the better part of the swarmes; they that escaped rose all out of the Hive, and went into another swarme which stood behinde them: of which, because they brought no Ruler with them, they were quietly received. 
\78. *The causes of a swarme going home againe./*/ Sometime a swarme being abroad, yea knit in the *Cone,/* will not abide, but returne home againe: the cause whereof is windie, wet, or cloudie weather, the not finding of a fit lighting-place, trouble in hiving, the hot standing of the Hive without defence, and the missing of their Prince. And this specially in a plentifull season, they being then as readie to returne upon little or no occasion, as loth to come abroad, even in the safest weather. *V.n./*20. I observed once, that the Prince being scarce ready, fell downe from the stoole unable to recover hir wings: whereupon the swarme returned. She being put up into the Hive, the next day the swarme rose againe and setled, but the Prince hapned to fall beside the *Cone/*. The swarme being knit, missing her, began to unknit, and be gone: which I perceiving presently hived them: but they bein still discontented, ranne up and downe the Hive, with a murmuring noise both without and within. Anone 
[cw: I had]

$*Of the Swarming of Bees,/*/$

I had espied about a handfull of Bees hanging upon a Nettle on the ground: among which was the Prince. When I had cut off the Nettle, and set it by the Rest under the Hives-kirt; presently the knot unknitting, I saw the lost Prince with hir long traine stately walking into the Hive. As soone as shee was entred, these Male-contents began to stand still and buzze, joyfully shaking their wings, as they wont to doe when they are pleased; and so quietly kept the Hive. To see the suddaine alteration among them presently upon hir approach, and how they could have notice of it all at once, as well they without, as those within, would even make a man to wonder; but that indeed all they doe is nothing else but wonders. 
\79. *How to stay them./*/ Swarmes that goe home, doe sometimes stay long before they rise againe: and when they rise (specially if they were hived) they are likely to fly away: although I have knowne a swarme to rise foure times in three daies, and at the last to be quietly hived. If therefore you perceive the swarme returning before many be entred the old stocke, shut the doore fast: if that will not serve the turne, carrie the old stocke away stoole and all, and set the swarme presently upon a stoole in his place. 
\80. *How to keepe them from other Hives./*/ And if anie of them be going into other Hives, (as sometimes, where the Hives stand neere together or are many, some of them, specially the young Nymphs that have not beene abroad before, will doe; *v./*) \*V.c./*2.*n./*17./ cover them with Mantles: for as many as enter will die, or scape narrowly. 
\81. *Set not a swarme neare an others hiving-place./*/ IF a swarme light neere the place where another was hived a day or two before; be sure to set it as farre as conveniently you may, from the place where the former lighted and stood: the space of a Pearch or somewhat lesse may suffice: other wise many of the first swarme resorting thither, will to the new swarme, and so be killed.

\82 *What to do when the swarme is now hived./*/ When your Bees are hived, those that hang on the outside, drive in gently with your Brush, and lay the corners of the Mantle that are farthest from the Rest, over the Hive, with boughes also to shadow it, if the weather be hot. But if you finde them unwilling to goe in (as in extreme hot 
[cw: weather]

===

$*and the Hiving of them./*/$

weather they will be, though they like the Hive well enough) then strive not with them; but laying the corners of the Mantle over the Hive, as before, with boughes to shade it, there suffer them till the heat be abated, and then drive them in: and if you thinke they cannot otherwise well endure that heat, cover the Hive againe with Mantle and Boughs. And so let it stand till it wax darke, and all the Bees be come home. 
\83. *How to remove it in the evening./*/ Then knitting the foure corners of the Mantle together, at the top of the hive, and binding the Mantle about close to the middle of the hive with a small line, carrie the swarme to his place. \84. *How to set it on his seat./*/ And after a while, taking away the Mantle, set it upon his seat with the doore toward the South, or rather South-west: *v./* \*V.c./*2.*n/*.15./ and then leaving only a breathing place, for feare of stifling them, cloome it up close, & put on a hacle *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*15.*&/*20.&c./ and so let it stand till it be faire and warme the next day. For if the Hive be leaft open; in the morning betimes they wil resort to their former standing and there abide, sometime flying about, sometime setling on the ground: where if the cold or wet take them many dye. \85. *How to use it in the morning./*/ When you see the weather fit them, then hanging the Mantle, or other white cloth upon the Hive, let them go. But they will the sooner leave the haunt of their hiving-place, & fal to their work; if you shew them their new standing by knocking them out together upon the stoole, when the weather is warme.  
All swarmes, if the morrow be faire, will desire to be abroad betimes: and knowing their want, will bestirre themselves more lustily in their labour than other Bees. \86. *Foule weather the first day doth much discourage a swarm./*/ But if the foule weather keepe them in the first day, then are they much discouraged: so that the next day being indifferent, when other Bees worke hard, they will scarce looke out of the doore, not daring to commit their leere and thinne bodies to the could aire. And if they be quite kept in the second day also; then will they not wagge (though they dye for it) untill the weather be very pleasant. \88. *A swarme may live six daies without Honie./*/ They may live five or six daies in the Hive without Honie: but afterward they begin to string downe, hanging at an others heeles. *Pedibus connexæ ad limina pendent./* \Virg./ Which is a certaine signe

of death, if they be not presently relieved. 
\89. *How to prevent the drouping and death of a swarme./*/ To prevent this evill, If the swarme light in your Garden within a Pearch of the Seat that is appointed for him, set it there at the first: and so will they lose no time in hankering about the hiving-place. And if it light farther off, (whether in your garden or other place where they may stand safe, specially the weather being unkinde or unconstant) leave them there till it mend. *v:/* \*V.c./*9.*n./*2./ for those that are not removed, but keepe still their first standing, because they are not to seeke of their way home, they feare the foule weather as little as the best. And therefore need not to be shut in in the morning, as those that are removed: or to have any white over them for their direction. 
\90. *How to secure a drouping swarm./*/ The meanes to recover such a drouping swarme is this. The first Sunne-shinie day turne up the Hive to the Sunne, that his heat may revive them: and besprinkling the sides of the Hive, the Spleets, and the Bees also a little with Mede or Honie-water; hold them so in the heat of the Sunne till you see many of them fly abroad. Then set downe the Hive gently upon his Seat againe, and cover it not til it be through warme, and the Bees play cheerefully, as at other Hives.

\1 *Bees most industrious creatures./*/
{U}Nto the industrious nature of Bees nothing is more odious then sloth and idleness: while there is matter to worke upon (unlesse they be let by unkinde weather) their worke never ceaseth: yea the old Bees, which have spent their daies in continuall labour, will not at the last allow themselves any immunitie or rest in their Hives, as a recompence

for their paines past, but continue still their travaile unto death: *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*58./
\2. *In three months they cannot worke./*/ In the three still moneths indeed, *Sagittarius, Capricornus/* and *Aquarius/*, because then there is nothing to gather, they worke not: (yet when a faire day or houre commeth, as wearie of rest, they will abroad, imploying themselves in divers necessarie offices: *v./*) \*v.c./*3.*n/*60 61./ but so long as any good flowers grow, even from *Pisces/* or a litle before unto *Sagittarius/* and, some yeares, somewhat after, (which is full nine moneths) they lose no time, (*Nullus, dum per cœlum licuit, perit dies/*) \3. *All the yeare after they lose no time./*/ but follow their businesse tooth and naile. \Nat.hist.l.11.cap.6./ \4. *Three fruits of Bees labour./*/ Which incessant labour while the time permitteth, with the three singular effects thereof, the (1) working of Wax, the (2) making of Honie, and the (3) feeding of their young *v:/* \*V.n.53./* Virg./ the Poet in few words hath elegantly expressed all together.  
*Quod superest, ubi pulsam hyemem sol aureus egit/*
*Sub terras, cœlumque, œstiva luce reclusit;/* 
*Illæ continuò saltus sylvasque peragrant,/*
*Purpureosque metunt flores & flumina libant/*

*Excudunt/* (1.) *ceras: &/* (2.) *mella tenacia fingunt./*

\5.*The first, and ground of all, is Wax./*/ Their first worke is the ground of the other two, the Artificiall Cells serving both for Coffers to lay their sweet measure in, and for neasts and nurseries to breed their young in. The matter thereof they gather from flowers with their Fangs: which, being kept soft with the heat of their little bodies, of the Aire, and of their Hives, is wrought into Combs. This worke is so nimbly and closely done, that it can hardly be perceived: insomuch that *Aristotle/* plainely confesseth, *Nec vero quemadmodum operantur visum adhuc est./* \His.l.9.c.40./ But *Plinie/* willing to goe a little beyond him, telleth us a tale of a Lanthorne-hive made at *Rome/* through which, forsooth, their doings in the Hive were discried: and in another place of another like device. *Multi alvearia speculari lapide focêre, ut operantes intus spectarent./* \Nat.hist.li.11.c.16./ \Nat.hist.li.21.c.14./ But unlesse the Bees also were transparent as well as the Hive, this cannot be: seeing they doe alwaies frequently compasse the Combs

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

round about. A more likely way than that, were to have a moveable peece in one side of the Hive: which when you have taken away, you may see the Drones and the Hony-Bees walking together to and fro, and with their doubled heat hatching their young: but their worke can you not see; though you remove and part the Bees till the bare Combes appeare. \7. *How you may see the working of the combes./*/ But if your curiositie would so faine behold the manner of their curious and artificiall building, the onely way is this. In *Gemnini/* set up a last yeeres midling swarme two or three handfulls above the stoole and then when most of the Bees are abroad (but most fitly in the forenoone when they are most quiet) you may behinde the stoole behold them working on the edges of their combes: and having blowne their liquid and soft wax out of their mouthes (as the Waspes doe their drossie stuffe, which you may see them gather from pales with their fangs and so carry it away) to fasten and fashion it with their fangs and forefeet. 
\8. *How much wax they bring at once./*/ How much wax they bring at once, doth appeare by the new swarmes: whose first weekes worke is spent chiefly in building combes: wherein they are so earnest, that it falleth out with them as it is in the Proverbe, *The more haste the worse speed./* For many of their burdens doe fall from them before they can fasten them to the Combes. You may then see great store of them upon the stoole by the skirts of the hive, like unto the white scales, which fall from young birds feathers. And therefore some have imagined, that they also are scales which the young Bees doe likewise shed from their wings. But put you some of those parcells together with warme fingers, & you will quickly be resolved of that doubt. 
\9. *The admirable Architecture of their combs and cells./*/ The Bees combes are placed otherwise then the Waspes: for the Waspes hang theirs one under another, and the Bees theirs one beside another; beginning them in the top of the hive, at that distance that a Bee may reach from one to another. 
Their cells or little holes are made six square, according to the number of their feet: and of that length and widenesse, that each of them may easily containe a Bee. Which are so artificiallie wrought and joined together, that *S. Ambrose/* in the consideration thereof saith. \Hexamer.l.5.c.21./ *Quæ castra quadrata tantum 
[cw: possunt]

===

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

possunt habere artis & gratiæ, quantum habent crates favorum, in quibus minutæ ac rotundæ cellulæ connexione sui invicem fulciuntur? Quis enim architectus eas docuit hexagonia illa cellarum indiscreta laterum æqualitate componere, ac tenues inter domorum septa ceras suspendere, stipare mella, intexta floribus horrea nectare quodam distendere?/*
But heerein their Art is yet more exquisite, that whereas there are two courses of cells in the two sides of every comb, the cel-bottoms in these two sides are never opposite one to an other: but each hexagonial bottom of one side answereth to three third parts of the hexagonial bases of three contiguous cells on the other side, meeting all in one angle right in the centre of the opposite bottome: as in this forme: {diagram} which is so articiall, as well for strength as beauty; that no schadon, though the thin bottome of his cell should faile, can breake through into a cell of the other side. Hee that sees this, sees not a wonder? 
\10. *The Drone-combe./*/ Besides these ordinary combes, there is commonly one Drone-comb in a hive, wherein the Cephens are bred, made for the nonce with wider cells. \His.l.9.c.40./ *Sunt loculi ipsi fucorum ampliores, & singuntur seor sim quoque, per se favi fucorum./* Although in some hives part of the Drone-combes be made out with Nymph-cells. The Drone-combe being no thicker than others, and yet the Drones longer then the small Bees; they increase the length of his cells by covering them, not with a flat cover, as they doe the rest, but with a deepe hollow one like an old wives thrumbd cap: which afterward, when the Drones are bred, they take away. And when those cells are void of Cephens, they fill them as they doe the other with hony: yea and after swarming-time, if they want upper cells for their hony, they wil not tarry til their Cephens come forth themselves, but liking better their roome then their company, they draw them out of their seminaries before they be ripe. \*v.c./*4.*n./*31./ 
\11. *The Queenes cels are built single in divers places./*/ But the Queenes cells are built single, every one by himselfe: and that in divers places of the Hive, some above, and some beneath: that, as other princes, she may for her delight remove at hir pleasure. But, for the most part, in the out-sides 
[of]

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

of the combes: for although it be fit for Princes to be neere their chiefe Cities; yet doe they not love to be pestered in the midst of them. \12. *In fashion round./*/ In fashion they are round: which is the most perfect figure, as the six square is most fit for comely joining many such buildings together. They are also larger than the rest, to shew that subjects houses should not match their Soveraignes in greatnesse. In these Palaces do they breed their young Princes, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*18./ \Nat.hist.l.11.c.11./ *Pliny/* speaketh thus of them: *Regias imperatoribus extruunt amplas, magnificas, separatas, tuberculo eminentes./* \13. *The common error anent these celles./*/ The common people, finding them alwaies in those stalls that die, take them for certaine signes of death, and call them pipes, or taps: and therefore when they see them in a stal that they take, they say, This was taken in good time, for it is piped: and therefore would have stood no longer. But seeing none are without, no not the yongest swarms; ordinary reason might teach them to forgoe that fond conceipt. 
\14. *The combes doe often change their hue./*/ The Combes have successively sundry colours: white, yellow, browne, blacke. \Virgin wax and ordinary./ Their first colour white, by the end of the Summer is turned to a light yellow. Those that are taken and tried this first yeere, are called Virgin-wax, but the whiter the purer: and the rest are ordinarie. The second Summer this light yellow is changed to a sad. The third this sad yellow into a browne: which afterward, as they wax old and corrupt, altereth againe into a blackish and durtie colour: but these being tried will returne to yellow. 
\15. *Wax is gathered onely in foure months./*/ The time when Bees gather wax, is onely betweene *Taurus/* and *Virgo/* (unlesse *Aries/* be milde and warme:) for then they may begin in that month. 
\16. *Hony the second fruit is gathered in 9. moneths./*/ BUt Hony they gather all the yeere: save only in those 3 *still/* moneths, when the weather keepeth in both Bees and flowers, *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*59./ \17. *Two sorts of Hony./*/ And it is of two sorts: the one pure and liquid, which is called *Nectar/*, the other grosse and solid, which we may by like by reason tearme+ *Ambrosia./* For both serve for the food of these divine creatures.
+Yea rather this is the true *Nectar & Ambrosia/* wherwith *Jupiter/* was first nourished in the Ile of Crete, *v.c./*4.*n./*6. while the *Curetes/* hid him from Saturn. Which gave occassion to the Poets of this fiction, that the Bees were his

nurses. *Dicteo cæll regem pavêre sub antro./**Virg.Geor./*4. And afterward, when they would make him immortal; because of the long-preserving vertue that hony hath, (*v.c./*10.*par./*3.*n./*1.) they fained it to be his immortall food. *Jupiter Ambrosia satur est & nectare vivit./* *Mart.l./*11.*Ep./*58.
\18. *How Ambrosia or grosse hony is gathered./*/ The grosse hony is gathered by their fangs: from whence is it conveied by the fore-legs to the thighes of the hin-legs (*Quæ flores comportant prioribus pedibus fœmina onerant propter id natura scabra, pedes priores rostro:totæq onustæremeant farcina pandatæ/*) \Nat.hist.li.11.c.10./ and that so nimbly, that unlesse you have a quicke eie, you can scarce perceive it. 
This worke may best be seene in the spring, when they gather upon the blackthorne: for then by reason of the cold they are not so quicke.
\19. *Ambrosia, is the Schadons food, as water their drinke./*/ When they have brought these burdens home; they unload them into the dry cells for their young to feed on, which are not yet able to flie abroad. And in the beginning and ending of the yeere, looke what they save when the weather is faire, they lay up for themselves against a rainy day. Which, while it is good, they will feed on, to save their *Nectar/* as much as may bee. \20. *Being kept it is soone corrupted./*/ But this kinde of hony is like unto fresh fish: it must not long be kept. \21. *And then becommeth most unsavory stopping./*/ For if being laid up in the cells, by reason of plenty that comes in fresh and fresh, it lye unspent; after a while it corrupteth, and of sweet becommeth the sowrest and the most unsavory of all things both to taste and smell: which then they commonly call Stopping or Coome. \22. *Much stopping maketh the Bees forsake their hives./*/ Where there is any store of this stuffe, it doth so offend the Bees, that oft times it maketh them to forsake all. Most of them will that yeere goe forth in swarmes: and those few that are leaft will never prosper.
\23. *This Ambrosia is commonly taken for wax./*/ Anent this leg-stuffe or grosse hony there is a generall error. For, without all scruple or doubt, men doe count it and call it wax: (as did some also in time of old, whose opinion *Aristotle/* doth thus deliver. \His.l.9.40./ *Ceram apes perreptando flores capiunt priorum acumine pedum: mox priores in medios abstergunt, & medios in blæsa posteriorum./*) But against (as I shall shew you) both sense and reason. 
\24. *Which error is disproved by sense./*/ If you put it to your tongue, it hath the taste of hony: which wax hath not. If you feele it betweene your warme 
[cw: fingers,]

fingers, it muttereth apart, where wax sticketh fast together. If you put it to the fire, it melteth not, as wax doth. And whereas wax is all of one colour, *i./* white at the first, *v./* \*v.n./*14./ even as those little fallings of the new swarmes; (which is wax indeed) this leg-honie is of divers colours, white, black, yellow, greene, red, tawny, orenge, murry, and of sundry midling colours. Therefore sense doth say it is no wax. 
\25. *And reason./*/ The reasons are two. The first is because when they gather abundance of this stuffe, they have never the more wax. The other because when they make most wax, they gather none of this. 
For proofe of the first, All Bees betweene *Virgo/* and *Taurus/* do gather abundance of it: and yet are not their combes in this time any whit enlarged. Also one of those old stalls that are full of combes, doth carry more of this matter all the summer long than many swarmes: and yet have they no more wax at the end of the yeere then at the beginning.
For proofe of the other, The new swarmes within one weeke, if the weather serve them, will have halfe filled their hives with combes: and yet in all this space shall you scarce see one carry any of this. If you would know the reason why the stocks gather so much, and the new swarmes so little; it is because the stockes have *schadons/* which they feed with it, and the new swarmes have none. And if any foolish Bee do carry in *Ambrosia,/* it is put a dry cell where it turneth to Stopping, *v./* \*v.n./*21./ as I have seene within a fortnight after the hiving. 
\26. *And by authoritie./*/ And this, though now it seeme new, yet was it knowne many ages agoe. *Plinie/* writeth of it thus. \Nat.hist.l.11.c.7./ *Præter hæc/* (*præter ceram & nectar/*) *convehitur erithace, quam aliqui sandaracham, alij cerinthum vocant. Hic erit apum dum operantur cibus: qui sæpe invenitur in favorum inanitatibus sepositus; & ipse amari saporis./* Speaking in the last words of that which is corrupted *v/* \*V.n./*21./. And before him *Aristotle/* himselfe thus. \Hist.l.9.c.40./ *Mel apibus tum estate tum hyeme cibo est: sed recondunt alterum quoq cibarii genus, cui durities ceræ proxima quod sandaracham nonnulli appellant./*

\27.*How the pure Nectar is gathered./*/ The *Nectar/* or liquid hony the Bees gather with their tongues, whence they let it downe into their bottles, which are within them like unto bladders: each of them will hold a drop at once. You may see their little bellies strut withall. Men thinke, because they see nothing on their legs, that they come in leere: when they are better and more heavily laden then the other. These bottles, as soone as they come home, they empty into their combes. \Hist.an.li.5.c.22./ *Mel ore evomunt in cellas./* This *Nectar/* being cleere as Crystall at the first and liquid as water, when it is two or three yeeres old, becommeth white and hard. *Concrescit autem mel concoctum jam tempore: initio enim, ut aqua, dilutum est, & primis diebus sine crassitudine cernitur./* \Hist.an.l.5.c.22/
\28. *Two sorts of Nectar./*/ \*Live-hony and stone-hony./*/
While it coninueth liquid, and will runne of it selfe, it is called live-hony: when it is turned white and hard (even like unto sugar) it is called corn-hony, or stone-hony.  
\29. *Live-hony of two sorts./*/ And the live-hony is of two sorts: that which is gathered by a swarme, cleere and crystalline at the first, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*2.*n./*13./ layd up in virgin-wax, *v./* \*V.n./*14./ and taken the same yeere, is the right virgin honie: the other, which is yellow and thicker, gathered by an old stall, and therefore kept in corrupter cells with drosse and courser hony, is called ordinary. 
\30. *The finest ordinary is a kinde of Virgin-hony./*/
The first shoot whereof (specially in a plentifull yeere of *Nectar/*-dewes) running sheere of it selfe, is a kinde of virgin-hony, *v./* and little inferiour to the right. 
*Nectar,/* whether it be ordinary or virgin-hony, is either finer or courser, according as the soile is where it is gathered: *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*2.*n./*6./ For the best countries, which yeeld the best wheat and the best wooll, yeeld also the best hony. And therefore the wood-lands of Hampshire have better honie than the heath, and the champion or field country, better than the woodlands. The reason is, because where the flowers are most fragrant and vertuous, as well of the fields as gardens, in the purest and sweetest aire; there are the honi-dewes, which are extracted from them, are most fine and pure, *v.n./*40.
\32. *The full cels they close with wax./*/ When the cells are full, they close them up with little filmes of wax, which they wil not breake untill winter and hunger drive them to it. And thus doe they all the summer,
[cw: descending]

===

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

descending lower and lower from one cell to another, untill *Virgo/*: after which time they lay up no more in store. For honie then waxeth scarce abroad: and thence-forth they can gather no more wax to shut it in. As for that which they purchase by sight and forraging, it doth them little good. For the most part of it they presentlie spend: and if they save any, they halfe fill a few cels with it: which being uncovered, either themselves or some other theeves quicklie devoure: according to the Proverbe, *Evill gotten goods are soone spent/*.
\33. *Nectar & Ambrosia made of many simples, whereof each moneth yeeldeth variety./*/ This *Nectar/* and *Ambrosia/*, together with those sweet and holesome vessells that doe containe them, are gathered from infinite varietie of herbs, flowers, and trees, which God in his provident bounty hath ordained to succeed one another. So that from *Pisces/* to *Sagitt./* there never want some plants or other, containing these sweets: which the Bees featly draw from them, without any hurt to the fruits: *Fructibus nullis nocetur/* \Nat.hist.lib II.c.8./
\34. *Dandelion continueth longest./*/ The Dent-delion, or after the French pronounciation Dandelion, may well be called *apiastrum/* or *mellissophyllon/*. For the Bees gather upon it almost all the yeere. The Dazy and Yelowcrea are next for continuance, but nothing so much regarded. 
\35. *What Pisces yeeldeth./*/ The Winter Giliflowre and the Hazell are the first. For they spring in *Pisces,/* and sometime before. After them the Dazy and the hearbe Bearefoot, the Violet, &c. 
\36. *What Aries./*/ In *Aries/* besides those before named, the Box, the Withy-palme, both greene yeelding *Nectar/*, and yelow yeelding *Ambrosia,/* Daffadill, Lide-lilie, blackthorne, &c. 
\37. *Taurus./*/ In *Taurus/* Slow-tree, Plum-tree, Goosebery not blowne, and blowne, Cherry, Peare, Cockbell, which is a Wood-flowre. About the middle of this month the chiefest plants begin to flourish in great abundance: as Apple, Crab, Barbery, Beech, Crowpickes, Charlocke, Rosemary, &c. But specially the plentifull Vetch and Maple. They gather on the flowre of the Maple a whole month together, and somewhat on the flowre of the Vetch when his time is *v./* \*V.n./* 39./ but the greatest store of hony is drawne out of the black Spot of the

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

little picked leafe of the Vetch, which groweth on each side the two or three upper-most joynts. These they ply continually: I never saw Vetches, how farre soever from Hives, that for three moneths together (if the weather served) were not full of Bees.
\38. *Gemini./*/ In *Gemini/*, the first moneth of fruitfull Summer, besides those prime Plants, Vetch and Maple (which now are in their prime) and the rest forenamed; Beanes also, which with their flowers have also blacke spotted leaves like Vetches, on which sometime they gather, Arch-angell, Barberie, Fumitorie, Ribwort a kinde of Plantanie, Holme or Hollie, Hawthorne, Elder, red Honie-suckle, Red-weede, white Honie-suckle, which they like much better than the red. &c. 
\39. *Cancer./* In *Cancer/* with the fore-named, the blossome of the Vetch, as well as the Leafe, Benet, Malowes, the soveraigne Tyme, which yeeldeth only *Nectar:/* and therefore he was deceived that said *Crura Thymo plena/*. Tyme, for the time it lasteth, yeeldeth most and best Honie: and therefore in old time was accounted chiefe \Pl.nat.hist.l.11.c.21./ \Hist.l.9.c.40./ Vir.Georg.4/ *(Thymus aptissimus ad mellificium. Pastus gratissimus apibus Thymum est. 
Dum Thymo pascentur apes, dum rore cicadæ./*) 
*Himettus/* in *Greece/*, and *Hybla/* in *Sicily/* were so famous for Bees and Honie, because there grew such store of Tyme: \Var.l.3.c.16./ *Propter hoc Siculum mel fert palmam, quod ibi Thymum bonum & frequens est./* The Knap-weed flourisheth about the middle of this moneth, and the Blackberie about a weeke after: Both which, as sweet and plentifull, the Bees much haunt.
\40. *Of Honie-dewes./*/ But the greatest plentie of the purest *Nectar/* commeth from above: which Almightie God doth miraculously destill out of the Aire \Virg.Georg./ (*aerei mellis cœlestia dona/*) and hath appointed the *Oake/* among all the trees of the Wood, to receive and keepe the same upon his smooth and solide leaves, (*Et quercus sudabunt roscida mella/*) \Virg.Pollio./ untill either the Bees tongue, or the heat of the Sunne have drawne it away. \41. *The Bees worke most earnestly in a Honie-dew./*/ When there is a Honie-dew, you may perceive by the Bees: for, as if they smelled it *v:/* \*V.c.1.n.44./*/ by the sweetnesse of the Aire, they presently issue out of their Hives, in great haste following one an

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

other: and refusing their old haunts, search and seeke after the *Oake:/* which for that time shall have more of their custome, than all the Plants of the Earth. Sometime the Maple and Hazell, take part with the *Oake:/* but little and seldome. While the Honie-dew lasteth, they are exceeding earnest, plying their businesse like men in Harvest: you may see them so thicke at the Hive-doore passing to and fro, that oftentimes they throw downe one an other for haste. 
\42. *What the Honie-dew is./*/ What this *Mel Roscidum/* should be, \Nat.hist.li.11.c.12/ *Plinie/* seemeth much to doubt where he saith *Sive illud sit cœli sudor sive quædam syderum saliva, sive purgantis se aeris succus./* But, if conjectures might be admitted, I would rather judge it to be the verie quintessence of all the sweetnesse of the earth (which at that time is most plentifull) drawne up, as other dewes, in vapours into the third Region of the Aire, by the exceeding and continuall heat of the Sunne; and there concrete and condensated by the nightly cold into this most sweete and Soveraigne *Nectar:/* and then doth it descend unto the earth in a dew or small drizling raine: that he might well say, *Constat materiam, ex qua mel gignitur, rori esse congenerem./* \Galen.de aliment. li.3/ Which opinion is the more probable for these reasons. First because that when the yeare is backward in his fruits, the Honie-dewes are also backward: comming onely at such time as the flowers have the most solid and best juyce. Before, when the juyce is weake and waterish, and afterward, when it is dryed and wasted, they are not. *v:/* \*V.+in/*43./ Secondly, because that in more hot & Southernly climats, where the fruits are more forward, the Hony-dewes also are more timely: as in *Italy/* before \Nat.hist.lib.11.c.12/ *Gemini. Non omnino/*, saith *Plinie, prius vergiliarum exortu: v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n/*20/ whereas with us they fall not usually before *Cancer/*. And thirdly, because the Countries that have store of the best and sweetest flowers, have ever the best Honie.*v.n./*29.
\43. *When the Honie-dewes are most frequent./*/ The hotter and drier the Summer is, the greater and more frequent are the Honie-dewes: cold and wet weather is unkinde for them: much raine at any time, as comming from a higher Region, washeth away that which is alreadie elevated: (so that there can be no more untill an other fit of hot

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

and dry weather) and in the end it dissolveth them quite.
\44. *The time when they fall./*/ The time in which these Honie-dewes fall, is usually betweene the first and last daies of this moneth: although the continuance of hot and dry weather may cause them come somewhat rather, or last somewhat longer, even untill mid-*Leo/* or+ after. They may happen at any time of the day: but for the most part in the morning before it be light: *Sub lucanis temporibus. Itaque tum prima aurora folia arborum melle roscida inveniuntur./* \Nat.Hist.li.11.c.12./ And then shall you have the Bees up in a morning as soone as they can see, making such a shrill noise where they goe, that as merrie Gossips when they meet, a man may heare them farther than see them. 
+In the yeare 1613, almost two moneths after the usuall time, namely in the later part of *Virgo,/* there fell divers Honie-dewes: which came to passe by reason that continuall wet kept them backe in their due time, and *Virgo/* followed exceeding hot, fit weather for them. But because the state of the flowers was then weake, the state of those Honie-dewes also was so weake, that the Bees were little the better for them. The stalls, that were taken, proved light: and most of the swarmes and stocks, that were kept for store, died for want before the end of Winter. Except onely in the Heath Countries, where the Heath-flower being then in his prime, those late Honie-dewes made fat stalls.
\45 *What Leo yeeldeth./*/ In *Leo/* Vetches, Malowes, Tyme, Knap-weede, Blacke-berie, white Honie-suckle, Redweed, Thistle, Melone, &c. 
Now also doe they gather on the Lavender, if their hastie Dames doe not gather it from them before it be readie.
\46. *Virgo./*/ In *Virgo/* Knap-weed, Black-berie, Redweed, Dandelion, Malowes, Borage, &c. and the ample Heath, which yeeldeth Honie like unto their Wooll. *V.n./*31.and *c./*10.*p./*2.*n./*12. 
\47. *Libra./*/ In *Libra/* Dandelion, Heath, Ivie, &c.
\48. *Scorpio./*/ In *Scorpio/* Dandelion, Ivie, Arch-angell, &c.
\49. *The Bees gather but of one kinde of of flower in one voyage./*/ And in this great varietie this is strange, that where they beginne they will make an end: and not meddle with any flowre of other sort, untill they have their load. *Mos apibus ne florum plura genera petant uno eodemq profectu, sed singulis singula./* Insomuch as those which beginne with the flower of the Vetch will not once touch \Hist.ac.l.9.c.40/ the rich spotted leafe of the same, before they have beene at home. Although when they come to a flower that yeeldeth both *Nectar/* and

===

$* Of the Bees Worke./*/$

*Ambrosia,/*, they wil use sometime the Tongue, and sometime the Fangs, and gather them both. 
\50. *They gather Honie out of poison./*/ But this may seeme more strange and wonderfull, that out of the most stinking and poisonfull weeds, as Redweed, +Margs,\+Mathers or May-weed, *Cotula fœtida/*/ Henbane, and the like, they gather most sweet and holesome Honie: and yet regard not the best and sweetest Hearbs and Flowers, as the Rose, the Prim-rose, Clove-Giliflowers; Wheat, Barley, Pease, &c.
\51. *What store of Honie a stall may have./*/ What store of Wax and Honie a stall may gather, is uncertaine: some having more, some lesse, according to the number of the Bees, the greatnesse of the Hive, and the plentifulnesse of the yeares. With us it is counted a good stall that yeeldeth two or three gawnes of Pulse: although in a tree there have beene found more than seven or eight. But in other Northerne Countries we reade of farre greater quantities. \Nat.hist.li.11.c.24/ *Plinie/* affirmeth, that there was seene in *Germany/* a Honie-comb eight foot long. And *Paulus Jovius,/* that in *Moscovia/* there are found in the Woods and Wildernesses great Lakes of Honie, which the Bees have forsaken, in the hollow trunkes of marvellous huge trees. \De legatione Moscovitarum, & Munsterus de Moscovia./ In so much that Honie and Wax are the most certaine commodities of that Countrey. Where, by that occasion, he setteth down this Storie, reported by *Demetrius/* a *Moscovite/* Ambassadour sent to Rome. A neighbour of mine (saith he) searching in the woods for Honie, slipt downe into a great hollow tree, and there sunke into a Lake of Honie up to the breast: where when he had stucke fast two daies, calling and crying out in vaine for helpe, because no bodie in the meane while came nigh that solitarie place; at length when he was out of all hope of life, he was strangely delivered by the meanes of a great Beare: which comming thither about the same businesse that he did, and smelling the Honie stirred with his striving, clambered up to the top of the tree, and thence began to let himselfe downe backward into it. The man bethinking himselfe, and knowing the worst was but death, which in that place he was sure of, beclipt the Beare fast with both his hands about the loines, and whithall made an out-cry as lowd as he could. The Beare being thus sud-

dainely affrighted, what with the handling, and what with the noise, made up again with all speed possible: the man held, and the Beare pulled, untill with maine force he had drawne *Dun out of the mire/*: and then, being let goe, away he trots *more afeard then hurt,/* leaving the smeared swaine in a joyful feare. 
\52. *Bees have necessarie use of water./*/ THE Bees earnest and hot Labour, and the drought of the Aire, together with their cholerike Complexion, which their very colour bewrayeth, doth cause them much to desire cold Water. \53. *Chiefly for their breed/*/ Some thinke it serveth onely to feede their Schadons: (*Aquam tum portant, cum prolem nutriunt) v:/* \Hist.an.l.9.c.40./ and that not without reason, seeing that *Ambrosia/* their daily food is hot and dry: and indeed when the Drones are done away, and breeding is ended, the Bees are nothing so frequent at the watring-places. But *Columella/* thinketh the use thereof to be more generall, \De re rust. l.9.c.5./ *Sine qua neque, favi, neque, mella, nec pulli deniq figurari queunt./* Unto whom the Poet, in the place first cited in this Chapter, seemeth to assent; making water and flowers the common matter of their three workes.
\54. *The making of the Watering place./*/ The Watring-place should+ not be farre from your Garden,+ in the next side of a Pond or Brooke made shelving, not very steepe, in manner of a Foord, and defended from Beasts, Geese, Duckes, and such like: and especially young Ducklings.*v./*¶ 3.*in.n./*59.
\Virg.Geor./
\55. *How to finde wilde Bees./*/ +For they will never goe farre for water, if any be to be had neere hand. *Sub mænibus urbis aquantur./* And therefore when you see Bees watring in woods or other places, not neere any Hives; bee sure those are wilde Bees, which are not farre from their neast. Watch them therefore which way they flie: for they will thence directly to it. Which if it be not within view, take a Reede or Kex, or some like hollow thing open at one end, with a chinke cut in the other to let in light: and taking up a Bee by the wings put her into the Cane, and shut her in with your thumb: while she goeth downe to the light, put in an other, and so many as you thinke good. And then where you last see the Bees flying homeward from the water, goe to that place, and there let out one of the Bees in the box: which, when she hath cast a Ring to know where she is, will fly as directly home as the other: likewise where you see her last, let out another: and so the rest, untill they have brought you to the stall.

+Lest the Bees, flying over the water unto it, be throwne downe by tempestuous winds, and so drowned: for which cause it is good to lay lugs overthwart the water, and other staies; that recovering them they may dry themselves againe, and so escape. 
\Virg. Geor./ *In medium seu stabis iners, seu profluet humor,
Transversas salices & grandia conijce saxa.
Pontibus ut crebris possint consistere, & alas
Pandere ad æstiniuum solem, si forte morantes
Sparserit, aut præcerps Neptuno immerserit Eurus./*
+That they may safely settle upon it, and that it may alwaies be kept moist by the neerenesse of the water. For they choose rather to draw their drinke out of moist earth, than from the water it selfe, though it never be so clear: peradventure that the earth having received his earthinesse, which before was insensibly mixt with the water, their triple searching tongue might the better trie out the pure element of water. 
+Which otherwise will be the death of many for they are so earnest in their businesse, that though you offer to tread upon them, they will not move. 
\56. *Bee-troughes in Gardens profitable./*/ But because in the cold windie weather of the Spring, (at which time of the yeare the Bees have most use of water, *v./*) \*V.n.53./*/ these watering places of Ponds and Brookes are dangerous; (where you may then see many throwne downe and drowned, and others, that scape drowning, to be so chilled, when they have filled themselves with cold water; that they are not able to endure the wind, but faile and fall by the way) therefore it is behoveful to have Troughes in your gardens, made for the nonce: whence the Bees may both sooner and safer fetch their water.  
\57. *The forme and size of a Bee-trough./*/ For the forme and size of a Trough, let his hollownesse be two foot in length, seven or eight inches in breadth, and foure in depth; the bottome foure inches thicke; the ends six or seven; and the sides halfe so much. Moreover, let the hollownesse be divided into foure equall parts, by one partition of inch-board, in the middle from side to side; and by two partitions of halfe-inch-board, from each end unto the middle partition: after this fashion.

\58. *The trough-cover, and the use of it./*/ And to keepe the Bees from danger of drowning, unto which they are very obnoxious, for it they but touch the water with their wings, they cannot rise from it) let each Quarter of the Trough have his Cover, in thicknesse about halfe an inch, in bredth and length fitting to his Quarter; but so, that without let it may rise and fall without the water. 
The matter of this Cover must be corke, which must as well have open spaces for the water to take aire; as places for the Bees to light on: lest it being covered too close, doe corrupt and become unsavourie. It is best to divide each cover into two equall parts: and in the edges on both sides to cut little nickes. And so this may be the forme of it. 

{diagram}

Other fashions both of their Troughes, and of their Covers, may be devised: but these have seemed to me in all respects most fitting. 
\59. *The seasoning and ordering of the Bee-trough./*/ A new Trough thus framed and fitted, is to be seasoned before it be used, by often scalding it, and changing the foule water; untill, having stood a day or two, it remaineth cleare, and without a glittering slime: afterward the older and more earthie it is, the better they like it. 
The Trough being seasoned, set in some convenient place, about a pearch from the Bees; having a moveable plancke,

or the like, to defend it from cold rough winds in the spring, and from the Sunne when it is hot. At which time keepe the Trough full, lest the water be soone over-heated: and in cold weather let the water be shallow, that the Bees may drinke safely below, out of the chilling wind. 
¶ 1. Bespread the ends of the Trough with cow-cloome, to keep them from chapping. 
¶ 2. In frostie nights cover all the Trough, to keepe the water from freezing. 
¶ 3. Keepe all Poultrie, and specially Ducklings, and Hens with chicken, out of your Garden: for, drinking at the Troughes, they will trouble, and tread upon the Bees. And the brood-hens will kill them, for feare of stinging their chicken: and so will Ducklings also at the first, taking them for flies; which when they have tasted, they will afterwards let alone. 
\60. *Bee-troughes of stone./*/ You may also make good Troughes of Free-stone, with woodden partitions let into the stone: but they are more apt to chill the Bees in cold weather, until they be mossie.
\61. *Sometime they water in the streets./*/ Sometime they will lie sucking at the neere plashes, puddles, and mire in the streets: where many are trod under foot of men and beasts. See therefore that such places be kept cleane and drie. 
\62. *And after a showre, all about the garden./*/ After a showre they water for the most part in your Garden upon the bare earth, the grasse, and wheresoever they finde it wet from above. In the chiefe breeding months *Aries,/* *Taurus,/* and *Gemini/*, *v./* \*V.c./*4.*n./*13./ when the colde raine or winde hath kept them in some part of the day, they wil lie so thick upon the ground, if you have any store; that you can scarce tread beside them. At such time therefore let no heedlesse stranger come among them.

For if he get into a Hive, he teareth downe the Combes, makes havocke of the Honie, and so starves the Bees. Some enter by the doore, or by some open place in the skirts of the Hive: some gnaw a hole throrow in the top of the Hive, where they know the Honie lieth: some keepe their old homes, and come to the Hive onely for their baits: some make their nests betweene the Hackle and the Hive, that they may the sooner, and the safer come to the Honie at their pleasure. 
\3. *Remedies against the Mouse./*/ For remedie, first you must looke that your Hives, whether they be of straw or wicker, be close and fast wrought. For if the straw be loose and soft, they will more easily gnaw their way thorow: and if the wicker be thinne, when they have torne down the cloome, they will creepe in betweene the twigges. Next see that the Hives bee daubed close round about the skirts, that there be no entring but by the Doore: which in the end of *Taurus,/* when the Bees come downe to watch, and thenceforth all the Summer, they will keepe well enough both day and night: but all the Winter, at which time the Mise make most spoile, it must bee made so narrow, that they cannot get in. *v./* \*V.c./*3.*n./*31./ Also it behoveth you to remove all things about your Hives, that may hide and harbour them, *v./* for they will feare

to come and goe in sight, lest the Cat meet with them by the way. Moreover, it is good now and then, in drie and warme daies, to take off the hackles, as well for this as for other causes. *v./* \*V.c.5.n.23./*/ Those that neastle upon the top of the Hive, when the hackle is taken off, will sit still amazed so long, that you may be sure to crush them against the Hive with your hand. Lastly, you shall doe well to set baited+ traps in their way, that so they may come short. 
\*A Samsons post./*/ There is none better than a Sampsons Post: which is a flat Cover or Roofe supported by a triangular Pillar or Prop, whose three sides doe so hold one by another, through the weight of the Roofe, that the loosing of one is the loosing of all: and so the Prop failing the Roofe falleth. 
\*The Roofe./*/ The Roofe may bee a Plankes or Boords end, or the like, twelve inches long and ten broad: which of it selfe, or with some advantage weigheth foure or five pound. 
\*The parts of the Prop./*/ The three sides or parts of the Prop (namely, the Post, the Sweeke, and the Brace) are three sticks, all almost halfe an inch broad, and halfe a quarter of an inch thicke. 
\*The Post./*/ The Post is moreover three inches and a halfe long, and sharpned at one end. 
\*The Brace./*/ The Brace likewise three inches and a halfe long, and sharpe at one end; with a nicke on the broad side halfe an inch within the other end.
\*The Sweeke./*/ And the Sweeke eight inches long, with a nicke on the upper broad side a little within the out-end; and another on the left edge, two inches and the thickness of the Post within the broad nicke.  
\*The framing of the Prop./*/ The parts of the Prop being thus formed apart, are to be framed together in a triangle, after this manner. First, take the Brace in your left hand and beare up the fore-side of the Roofe with the blunt end, the nicke being inward: then set up the Post somewhat leaning toward you, with his sharpe end in the nicke of the Brace: then hooke the edge-nicke of the Sweeke to the Post: and make all fast with the sharpe edge of the Brace fixed in the broad nicke of the Sweeke.   
\*The baiting of the Sweeke./*/ But first bait the Sweeke with the thinne peece of good Cheese, or Bacon, or Suet, tyed with a thread upon the inner end. And bee sure that the Prop doe stand so fickle that it may easily be loosed: and that the Roofe when it falleth, lie flat and even with the Floore, lest the poore Mouse lose hir labour.

\5. *The Tit-mouse./*/ Of Titmise, there are three sorts. The great Titmouse (which of his colly head and breast some call a Colemouse) is a very harmefull Bird. For although sometime hee seeme content with dead Bees, yet is hee a great devourer of the quicke also. \6. *The subtill practice of the Tit-mouse./*/ In winter hee taketh them at the Hive as they come forth: when the cold makes them keepe in, hee will stand at the doore, and there never leave knocking till one come to see who is there: and then suddenly catching her, away he flies with her: and when he hath eaten her, he comes againe for more: eight or nine will scarce serve his turne at once. If the doore be shut that none can come forth, hee labours to remove the Barre: if that be too heavie, he falls to

moining about the doore for a new way: and when these devices cannot get them out; some have the skill to breake the wals of the daubed Hives above, over against the place where they lie: and there they are sure to have their purpose. But in the spring, when the Bees come to the palme, hee standeth there watching for them; and while they are busie at their worke he devoureth many. The little Russet one in Winter feedeth only on dead Bees; but in the Spring he will take part with the great one. The little greene Titmouse I cannot accuse. 
\7. *The Swallow./*/ The Swallow taketh them as they flie, *Populatur hirundo,/* & alibi *Ea demum sola avium non nisi in volatu pascitur/*: \Nat hist.li.11.c.18/ \Nat hist.li.10.cap.24./ But I am perswaded she doth much lesse harme than the Titmouse, although she have a worse name. The Long-winged Hauke makes the fairer flight; but the short-winged is the Kitchen-hauke. These birds therefore are not to be suffered.

+As Cage traps, Pit-falls, and Samsons-Posts (*v./* + *in n.3/*) But then set a Lath before the Prop, leaning from the Floore to the Roofe, lest the busie Bird throw it downe for nothing. 
\9. *The Hornet./*/ The Hornet also devoureth Bees: being so much too strong for them, that they can make no resistance. Which the Poet meant where he said 
*Aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis./* 
Hir manner is to fly about before the Hive, till she have spied hir pray settled at the doore: and then suddenly she taketh it in hir feet, and flieth away with it as a Kite with a Chicke.

\10. *The Hornets sting is dangerous./*/ In destroying the Hornets you must bee warie: for one stinging doth ofttimes cause a Fever, and lesse than thirtie, as some say, will kill a man. \Nat.hist.li.11.c.21./ *Ictus crabronum haud temerè sine febri est. Auctores sunt ter novenis punctis interfici hominem./*
\11. *The Waspe./*/ The Waspe doth much more hurt than the Hornet. For the Hornet now and then killeth a Bee: but the Waspe wasteth the Honie, whereby many whole Stalls doe perish. For besides the harme that she doth hir selfe, she doth ofttimes set the Robber *v./* \*V.n.25./* on worke: who, when the Waspe hath begun, will be readie to take part with her, add then all goes to wracke. A Waspe is by nature harder and stronger then a Bee, specially in *Libra/*: insomuch that ofttimes she breaketh from two or three of them, though they have all hold of her at once: and perhaps killeth one of them out of hand. \12. *When she feeds upon Bees./*/ At *Cancer,/* or, the Spring being hot and drie, in the later part of the former moneth, the Waspe beginneth to bee bred: *v./* \*v.c./*4.*n./*8./ within a moneth after shee first appeareth: and in a while she beginneth to feed upon dead and weake Bees: which she quickly cutting of in the middle with hir Fangs, first carrieth away the neather-part; and anon fetcheth the other, when she hath bitten off the wings (for easier carriage) not farre from the place where she took it up. 
\13. *When she stealeth Honie./*/ Within a moneth after hir comming abroad, shee waxeth bold, and adventureth into the Hives for honie: but, by reason of the strangenesse of hir voice and habit, shee is descried before shee come neere: And at the first (while the weather is warme, and the Bees both early and late keepe watch and ward at the Hives doore) comming single against many, she is commonly repulsed, and sent backe againe with a Flea in hir eare: and if by chance she slip in, she doth not alwaies escape. Sometime she is killed in the Hive, and brought forth dead: and sometime without doore, when she hath got hir prey. But afterwards, the weather waxing cold, and specially in mornings and evenings, and the Bees therefore retiring from the doore higher into the Hive; the Waspes make great spoile, specially among them that are weake. And this they continue untill *Scorpio:/* after which time they begin to weare. \14. *When they weare away./*/ Neverthelesse while they live, that is until

\15. *In what yere the Waspes are few./*/ The Winter wet and cold, killeth many of the Mother-Waspes *v./* \*V.c.4.n.8./*/ as they lie in their sleepe. The Spring wet and cold hindereth their breeding: for being by that meanes kept in, when their time is come to flie abroad and feed; they pine and faint, so that either they breed not at all, or verie late. And when a warme fit in the beginning of *Aries/* having let them abroad, cold and stormie weather commeth suddenly upon them; they are shut up againe, and so starve the the most part with hunger and cold: that your Bees shall not be much troubled with them in such a yeere. Yea continuance of wet, though without cold, is such an enemy to the Waspes; that in the yeere 1613, though, the former Summer being exceeding dry, the Waspes were multiplied, and the Winter being milde, the Mother-Waspes were many at first; yet the Rainie Spring and Summer, did so spill their nests, that there were no small Waspes seene till *Libra/*, and then verie few. 
\16. *In what yeere they abound./*/ But the Winter being milde, and the Spring and Summer continuing warme and dry, they live and breed in everie place: that, without continuall and diligent attendance, you shall be sure of great losse among your Bees, though the former yeere there were but few: For one nest yeeldeth breeders enough, if they should all live, to store a whole countrey. 
For these causes, *Ann./* 1611. there were every where such multitudes that the like I thinke was not knowne before in our memorie: insomuch that within two or three Furlongs of my Garden, were killed that Summer above fiftie great nests: (and yet, by the resort to our Bees, wee knew we had not all) besides 22. Mother-Waspes killed in the Spring at our Bee-trough, which would have made so many nests. And 1620. for the same causes the number was as great or greater: and yet the exceeding wet Summer following I saw not one small Waspe.

If in the ground (as most commonly they are) you may likewise scald them, and so take the Combes out whole, and give the Grubs to your Chicken: although the Boyes make better sport in burning them. But if you be in haste, and care onely to dispatch them quickly and quietly, thus doe. First, stop their way close; that they within breake not out upon you (for those that are abroad comming home wearie and loaded are more gentle.) Then presently with a + Waspe-spade search for the Nest: which, if it be shallow, is quickly found. When you have found it (which you shall know by the easie entrance of the Spade) then dig downe round about it: and having thus rounded the Nest, stamp the earth downe upon the Combes, and so have you done. If you finde not the Nest because it lyeth + deepe; then dig up the ground a foot about the hoale; and having found their way, stop it fast with earth, and tread in that you digged out, and let them alone. If this be done in the day when many are abroad; the evening or morning following you may kill them with your foot: but in the evening you may take them all together.

\19. *The Snaile/*/ They offend the Bees also with their mealinesse, as the Snailes doe with their sliminesse. Wherefore rid your Hives of these guests. The Moths are easily crusht before or upon the Hive: and the Snailes, though you kill them not, will not long abide, if there be no harbour of long Grasse, Weeds, or other things about the Hives. \20. *What harme the Moth doth./*/ But as for the Moth, if you suffer her, your selfe shall have more cause than your Bees to bee offended. For albeit in the cold Spring shee breed above the Hives, hatching hir young by the heat of the Bees; yet when the heat of the aire will suffice for that purpose, shee chooseth rather to lay her blotes in woollen, their naturall nest and nourishment: especially if it bee nappie, that there she may safely hide them. In which place, till they be growne to their bignesse, they lie fretting and eating the Cloth: and then after a while they creepe out of their skins flying Moths. The Maides that sunne their clothes to rid the Fleas, let them take heed how they doe it neere the Bee-fold, lest they bring in worse enemies than they carried out. If the Woollen be oylie or greasie they like it the better: and for that cause good Huswives Yarne lyeth not long unwoven.

\22. *The Spider./*/ The Spider, as the Moth, doth use to harbour betweene the Hackle and the Hive: where commonly she hath a Bee or twaine in store to feed on, an unfit messe for such a mouth: Sometime she hangeth hir Nets under the Stoole; which easily intangle a wearie Bee, when she commeth laden home, and missing of the lighting place falleth into them: yea, and sometime where the Bees are few, chiefly in the winter, they will bee bold to enter the Hive, and there weave their fatall Webbes, *In foribus laxos suspendit aranea casses/* \Virg.Nat hist.l.11.c.19./ *Aranei quoq vel maximè hostiles: cum prævalvere ut intexant, enecant alveos./*
\23. *The Toad./*/ The Toad is by nature so noysome to the Bees, that while he is about the Hive, though he lie but under the Stoole, the Bees will not prosper. \*The Frog/*/ He is said also to devoure them at the Hive, as the Frog at the Watring-place. \Hist an.l.9.c.40./ \Ibidem./ *Ranæ Apes, ubi ad aquam accesserint, rapiunt: quamobrem eas Apiarii per paludes & stagna, unde Apes aquantur, venari solent.

\25. *The Bee the Bees greatest enemie./*/ But not any one of these, nor all these together doe halfe so much harme to the Bees, as the Bees. *Apes api,/* as *homo homini, Lupus/*. They make the greatest spoile both of Bees and Honie. For as they of the same Hive live in inviolable peace one with an other; so have they no entercourse, no friendship or societie with others, but are rather at perpetuall defiance, and deadly feud with them.

\26. *Robbing or fighting of Bees in winter and summer but little./*/ This robbing is practised all the yeere. In winter, as oft as the weather is faire and warme, some will bee prowling abroad. And some are so theevishly disposed, that all the summer long, when abundance of Honie is every where to bee had for a little labour, they will yet be filching though they die for it. \27. *In the spring more earnest./*/ In the Spring they are more earnest; finding now fit time to fetch after that which they leaft behinde at Harvest, *v./* \*V.n.28.&31./*/ and to repaire their decayed store, both of Honie and Bees. *v./* \*v.n.42./*/ And therefore now have an eie unto them: and defend the weaker swarmes from their violent irruptions. *v./* \*V.c.3.n.65./*/ Those Stalls that have lost their Queene, or too many of their companie, or are offended with the corruptnesse of their Combes, or doe dislike their standing for coldnesse, moistnesse, mustinesse, bleetnesse, or unsavourinesse; as taking no pleasure in their lives, doe now easily suffer themselves to be robbed. And if none will come to rob them; then on some faire day they will away together, sometime leaving both Honie and young ones behinde them. 
\28. *The most spoile is made in Harvest./*/ But in *Virgo/* is the most dangerous time of all. Then shall all the Stalls in your Garden bee tryed of what mettle they are made. And *Libra/* would not be much better, but that the most spoile is done before. \29. *What Stalls are most subject to robbing./*/ Little and poore swarmes are now subject to robbing. Likewise those Bees that are offended with the blacknesse and rottennesse of their Combes, caused through age, or wet, or with abundance of noisome stopping; will most of them goe forth in the swarmes, leaving a very few, sometime not past a handfull, in the stocke: which yet in robbing-time will keep the doore, as though the Hive were full: but the Robbers finding their weaknesse, will surely spoile them, if they bee not prevented. How to know such weake Bees, and what to doe to them, see further *c./*3.*n./*46.

Of which opinion was *Plinie/* where hee said. *Quod si defecerit aliciuis alvei cibus, impetum in proximas faciunt rapinæ proposito/*. But indeed such are fitter to be robbed, as before is said, than to be robbers. There is no theefe to the rich theefe: who, although he have enough, and more then enough; yet by hooke or by crooke hee will have more, though the poore starve for it. 
\31. *How they begin the fray./*/ At the beginning of Wheat-harvest, the state of flowers decaying, which is alwaies about *Virgo,/* the maine robbing beginneth. Then doe they send forth some of their stoutest yonkers to spie and give the onset: which going about from Hive to Hive so farre as their walke extendeth, doe prove all. Where they have once sped, at their returne they bring more of the their companie; untill in the end that whole Stall bee made acquainted with it. Sometime it happeneth, that though there be an hundred Stalls within a walke; yet the robberie is done altogether by one: sometime by two or three, all the rest being quiet. \32. *Theeves of divers Hives agree together in robbing./*/ And this one thing is strange, that whereas no Bees will abide strangers in their Hives with them; yet theeves wil suffer one another, and agree all in stealing, though they be of divers Hives.
\33. *The description of the Bees battell./*/ When the theeves, having first made an entrie, begin to come thicke, and the true Bees perceive themselves to bee assaulted by many; they suddenly make an out-crie: and issuing out of their holds by troopes, presently prepare themselves to battell. Some keepe the gates: some as Scout-watches fly about: some runne in againe to see what is done there: some beginne to grapple with the Enemie: and that with such a noise and dinne, as if the Drum did sound an all-arme. \34. *In the battell is heard a sound like a Drum and a Flute./*/ Besides which base sound, you shall eftsoones, in the heat of battell, heare a more shrill and sharpe note, as it were of a Flute.

Likewise without you may see some slaine forthright with the thrust of the Speare: some so deadly wounded, that they are not able to goe three foot from the place: and some more lightly strooken, presently to lose the use of their wings, and for a while to leape up and downe, forward and backward, like mad things.

If you would know whether this fight bee in jest or earnest, with fellowes or with foes; the manner, and the end thereof will shew you.

And then they draw together at the Citie-gates: and there they buzze one to another, as if in their language they did talke of the fight, and commend one an other for their fortitude. 
\41. *The second assault of the enemy./*/ The Robbers, prevailing not that day, will up the next day so soone as it is light, an houre before the Bees use to come abroad: and then doe they make a fresh assault. The Bees finding the enemy among them, are presently up in armes: and so beginnes the seconde skirmish, which, without the taking of the Citie or the overthrow of the assailants (which seldome hapneth) continueth, untill very darknesse part them.
\42. *When the true Bees yeeld, they go with the Conquerors./*/ When the true Bees, finding themselves overmatcht with multitude, see there is no remedie, and that no resistance will serve; at length they yeeld, and suffer the Conquerours quietly to spoile their goods. And after a while, when, by being together in the same Hive and sucking the same Honie, all smel alike; they will joyne with their enemies, and help carrie away their owne goods, and so become friends and live together. At night they lodge with them: but in the day-time they returne with their new fellowes to fetch that is leaft behinde. By this meanes some venterous stalls are suddainly much increased both in Bees and Honie: although when a Swarme not over-stored conquereth a poore stall, and so getteth, by the victorie, more eaters than meat; it
[cw: turneth]

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

turneth to their owne overthrow: for when their food faileth they dye all together. 
\43. *Remedies./*/ Seeing therefore in so cruell and continuing a fight ofttimes the enemies are Conquerours, and then all is lost; and if they be vanquisht, yet this victorie is not without losse of men and goods, which the enemy ever nowe and then shifteth away; I know your desire is to know how to succour the true men, either by preventing this dangerous conflict, or by rescuing them in the same. For the first read *c./*3.*n./*45.46.47. \44. *To prevent robbing./*/  For the other many practises have been tried: some cast dust, some drinke among them: the one whereof doth no good, the other harme. \45. *And to stay it, if you find it in time./*/ For drinke maketh them to smell all alike, so that the true men cannot knowe the Theeves from their fellowes: and therefore some use to do so, when two swarmes are put together, that they may seeme to be of one companie. If these usual helps be no helps, what help is there then? If you perceive their fighting in time before any great harme be done, then this must you doe. First stop them up close that none can passe either in or out, leaving onely a breathing place. Then shal you have a double conflict; one within, an other without. The theeves that are within, having no way to escape with their preyes, first or last will be slaine all. They that are without, after a little wrestling, seeing nothing to be had but blowes, will not long abide this bootlesse danger. When you perceive the siege to be raised, and that there is little or no fighting without; (which will be about an houre after) then may you let out your Bees, making the doore halfe an inch high, and scarce halfe an inch wide. Those few that were within will they bring forth to buriall; some then, some on the morrow. In the evening, when the Bees are all in, shut them up as before. The next day betimes, before the Bees would be abroad, must you looke for some of them againe. When they are come, beat them away with a bough, but kill them not: for so may you do your neighbour a shrewd turne, and your selfe too. 
But let not the Bees out before noone: and then make the doore so narrow, that but one Bee may passe at once. So 
[cw: will]

=== 

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

will they keepe the Robbers out, and follow their businesse neverthelesse. The next day you may let them out rather: and if the doore be so narrow that it hinder their passage, you may make it wider. If this doe not suffice, but still the strange Bees will strive to get in; assure your selfe that stall will yeeld. And therefore if you bee loth to take it now, because of the Schadons that may corrupt the Honie; *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*2./ then you must looke unto him carefully, lest by little and little it come to little or nothing. 
\46. *When it is too late, and what is then to be done./*/ But if the Bees have yeelded before you are aware of it, so that the theeves rob quietly with out resistance; or have broken the Honie-cels; (which you may perceive by the crumblets of Wax upon the stoole) then, having shut the Hive close assone as you can, the next evening or morning take that is leaft: otherwise in the end you shal lose all. For the Bees there-about smelling the Honie when the Combes are broken, will have it or die for it. 
This fierce and cruell robbing being alwaies in Harvest, when people are busie in the fields; many Hives are leaft Honie-lesse, and they never the wiser. Wherefore it is good to leave some body at home, as well to watch these, as the two legged Robbers. 
\47. *Robbing hurtfull also to the Theeves./*/ Neither is this robbing hurtfull onely to those that are robbed, but to the Robbers also. For many of them are daily cut off in the assault: (you may see them lye sprawling at everie Hive-doore) whereby their whole stall sometime is so weakned; that, while they seeke to prey upon others, they become a prey themselves. 
\48. *In what yeeres robbing is most rife/*/ After a moist Spring, when Swarmes are most plentifull, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*5./ is robbing most rife: otherwise there is lesse danger. 
\49. *Bees kill poore swarmes that wander in the spring./*/ Besides those Bees that are thus spoiled in robbing, many also are killed by other stalls when they come to them for succour. For in the Spring those Swarmes that were lateward, or have beene halfe-robbed; when they have spent all their store, the next warme day after, away they flye: some to a tree where they hang till they be dead: some adventure into other Hives, where if they have large entrance, that they may throng in suddainly; sometime they scape with

the death of some few, and being mingled together continue with them as one stall: but for the most part they die every each one. *v./*c.1.*n/*22. 
\50. *To prevent the death of poore swarmes/*/ To prevent this losse, (1) when you percieve them to wax light and weake; drive them into a stall that hath provision enough, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*10./ (2) If it be your hap to see them entring a stall that is well stored, lift up the Hive and let them in together, and so perhaps they may scape: and (3) if you finde any hanging abroad, you may put them into what stall you list; by rearing the stall before a handfull from the stoole, and laying the Bees upon the Table, *v./* close to the doore. 
\51.*Many killed in swarming/*/ Lastly, the Bees doe much destroy one another in swarming-time. *v.c.5.n./*64,65,66,68,75,76,77,80,&81.
\52. *The weather./*/ Next unto Bees, the greatest Enemy that the Bees have is unkinde Weather: whereby at all times of the yeare both they and their fruits are much empaired.
\53. *In Summer heat hurteth the Bees./*/ In Summer extreme heat melteth the Combes (specially of Swarmes) and so sheddeth 
the Honie; if the Hives be not shaded, and well hackled. It also causeth the Bees to lye out, and so hindreth their swarming. *v.c./*5.*n./*20.
\54. *In Winter the Sun-shine in frost and snow./*/ At Winter, the Sunne shining in frostie or snowie weather, is dangerous to the Bees. For the shine tilleth them abroad, and the Frost chilleth them: many as they flye, that they canot returne: and many that returne, while they rest on the ground before the Hive. But the Snow amazeth them, and dazeling their eyes causeth them presently to fall, and with his vehement cold to rise no more: and most of all then, when, to shun the wind, they light in the shade. \55. *The remedie./*/ And therefore if, the Snow lying, the mildnesse of the weather draw them abroad; it is good to strew the Snow with straw, not onely in your Garden, but also without the fences, specially in the Lee-sides, if conveniently you may: and so shall you save a number; which else you might see lying about, like slaine men in a foughten field.  
\56. *Also the Eastern winds and great frosts./*/ Also the freezing Easterne winds, and great Frosts kill many in the Hives that be open, or uncovered: and therefore at such times it is good to shut them up close, *v./*  \*v.c./*3.*n./*61./ and to

see them well hackled, *v.c./*3.*n./*15.
\57. *And the cold continued maketh them sicke./*/ And if the cold continuing keep them long in, it maketh them so sicke, heavy, and chilly; that many dye assone as they come abroad into the aire, unlesse it be very pleasant, *v.c./*3.*n./*62.
\58. *The raine rotteth the Hives./*/ Also the raine doth oft-times soake into the Hives, and so corrupteth the Combes, and killeth the Bees: specially where the company is small, not having heat enough to drie them againe. 
\59. *The remedy./*/ Wherefore provide thay alwaies your hackles be good. And for remedie (if any such chance happen) pull off the hackles in warme daies, that the Sunne may dry the Hives againe. 
\60. *the greatest losse by weather is in the spring: for then infinite multitudes are beaten downe, laden and wearie with stormes and wind./*/ But the greatest losse is in the Spring. For the Bees, specially the young frie (being laded and wearie with their labour) some at their worke, some in the way home, some at the Hive-doore are beaten downe; not onely through suddaine stormes, but also through cold rough winds: and then, unlesse the Sunne shine or the wind lye, they never come home againe: insomuch that sometime you may see the Lanes *v./* \*v.c./*1.*n./*49.61./ strewed with them.
\61. *At the rising of a Cloud they post home./*/ And therefore, when being a field they see a stormie or rainie Cloud arising, presently they hie them home for life: tumbling to the Hive as thick as Haile, thronging, and throwing downe one another before the doore for haste. \62. *Yet will they goe a field in the midst of a warme shower./*/ Where, if the cold raine catch them before they can recover the Hive, they are in no better case then those that the storme beat downe by the way: although, when they are fresh and light, they will fly abroad in the midst of a warme shower, not caring for it.
They which are thus taken abroad, must take their chance: but if you defend your Bee-garden as you ought, *v./* \*v.c./*2.*n./*2.3.4&5./ you shall prevent the fall of many at home. And those that you finde chilled with cold (though they be quite dead, without sense, motion, and breath, yea and have lien so all the day) you may, if you be disposed, revive with the warmth of your hand; so that it will seeme a miracle unto you. For presently (their spirit returning) you shall see them begin to pant and breath againe: and anone they will flye away as lustie as the

$*Of the Bees Enemies./*/$

best. But if you spie any store of such dead or halfe-dead Bees, then your way is to put them in a Glasse, and covering it, to turne it round against the fire, till you see them ready to flye. 
\64. *The wind causeth many to be drowned./*/ Also where Palme-withies, or other trees whereon they gather; doe hang over the water; the rough winds throw downe and drowne a number of them, while they bee at worke. Many also, where there are no such trees, when they come but to drinke. 
For remedie of the first, cut downe the trees: and for the other, see *c./*6.*n./*56.
\Nat.hist.l.11.c.19/ *Tot hostibus, tot casibus, tam mumificum animal expositum est./*
\66. *The last and worst Enimie of all./*/ ¶ There remaineth yet another Enemie worse than all these. For these all doe wrong the Bees but by little and little; some in their goods, some in their persons: and there is a remedie shewed, if industrie be not wanting, against them all. But this, when he commeth, playeth sweep-stake with them; carrying away both Honie, and Wax, and Bees, and Hive, and all at once: and there is no sufficient remedie found, either in the Bee-master, of in the Bees themselves against him: neither shall I, with all my skill, be ever able to devise any; unlesse the wisest of the Land, when they meet together, will joyne with me in the invention. For the first the Bees are least destitute of their Keepers helpe, seeing at the times of greatest danger, he cannot alwaies be *sub Dio/* with them, nor they conveniently *sub Lare/* with him: although some have, for their safetie, put this in practise, housing them and shutting them up close all the Winter: but not without much inconvenience. For by this meanes they are debarred of their necessarie recreation *v:/* \*V.c./*1.*n./*59.*&c./*3.*n./*60./ in a warme houre, when it happeneth: and if by chance they breake forth, they lose their way in againe, and their lives withall. And as they want herein their Keepers helpe, so have they no meanes to save themselves, no not so much as the silly sheepe, which happily may runne away. For their resistance, which against some Enemies doth often prevaile, against the violence of this flie *Tenebrio/* availeth nothing at all: who stealing upon

them while they be at rest, & suddainly surprizing them, carrieth the poore Captives (alasse) they wote not whither. Although I have read a Storie of a Stall, that being stolne did sharply punish the Malefactor, making him submit himselfe unto their Master, and to aske him forgivenesse. Indeed I will not be bound for the truth of it, for it is no childe of mine: but if any man desire to take it as it is, he shall have it as good cheape as I. *Cum nocto latro apes S. Medari sub-ripuisset, apes ipsæ in sancti viri ultionem, relictis vasis suis, in malefactorem illum circumquaque diffugientem acerrima catenus instimulatione perfecutæ sunt, quosque ad Sanctum, vellet nollet, regrederetur, & ejus provolutus vestigiis suppliciter pro commisso crimine veniam precaretur. Cui mox ut Sanctus manum extendit benedictionis; apes, tanquam obedientes, ab ejus insecutione cessaverunt, & antiquo Domnini sui dominio evidenter sese reddiderunt./* Laur. Surius in vita S. Medardi.Tom.3. When a Theefe by night had stollen *S. Medards/* Bees, the Bees in their Masters quarrell, leaving their Hive, set upon the Malefactor, and eagerly pursuing him which way soever he ranne, would not cease stinging of him, until they had made him, whether he would or no, to go backe againe to their Masters house, and there falling prostrate at his feet, submisly to crie him mercie for the crime committed. Which being done, so soone as the Saint extended unto him the hand of benediction; the Bees, like obedient Servants, did forthwith stay from persecuting him, and evidently yeelded themselves to the ancient possession and custodie of their Master. 
It were to be wished that *Pares culpâ/* might be Pares pænâ, that all like offendors might have like punishment. But sith our Bees are not of *S. Medards./* kinde, thus to rescue themselves from this michievous Enemie; it is meet their merit procure them a protection: and as they provide for the health and safetie of men, *v:/* so men should provide for the safetie and secure being of them. That such as delight in things for their Country so profitable, might not by idle and theevish Varlets, unprofitable members of the Common-weath, be discouraged in their honest courses. Where-

fore I humbly and heartily entreat all those, whether they be high or low, which shall reape either profit or pleasure by these my paines, that they would endeavour, as much as in them lyeth, by themselves and by their friends, that against this odious rapine it may be enacted, as a Law of the *Medes/* and *Persians/* which altereth not; that they which feloniously breake open these true labourers houses, shall, like other House-breakers, bee deemed and judged as guiltie of Burglairie, and so have no benefit or favour by the *Muses/*, that thus violate the *Muses/* sacred Favourites. And heere, now my hand is in (though it may seeme a hard digression) let me begge the like boone for those other necessarie creatures, which, for their like certaine and generall profit, the Proverbe hath joyned with them in speciall commendation to the world. 

*Who so keepe well Sheepe and Been,/*
*Sleepe or wake, their thrift comes in./*

They serve for mans use both without and within, not only to feed the belly, but also to cloath the back: for which necessarie uses, they deserve especially to be beloved and defended of all. And yet I thinke that in any thing, nay in all things else, there is not so much wrong and spoile done to the Countrey, as in them alone: Sheepe-stealing, through foolish pittie, is now growne so common and so continuall. Whereby, besides the infinite losses which true Subjects daily suffer in that kinde, the Commonwealth sustaineth an other great damage in Corne; the Husbandmen oft-times fearing and forbearing to fold their Land, lest their losse should be greater than their gaine. Surely, in my opinion, the very Boot-halers, or High-way-Robbers are more worthy favour than such. For they are men of more generous spirits, both apt for service themselves, and to breed bold Souldiers for their Prince and Country, who, by good admonition, better imploiments, or conscience of the sinne, are oft-times reclaimed: Whereas these Night-Ravens, for the most part, are base cowardly Knaves, neither fit for service, nor labour, a meere burthen to the Common-

##CHAP. VIII/##
##*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/##

{T}Hree moneths of the twelve are rich and plentifull (in which the Bees gather abundantly, and store themselves for all the yeere) *Gemini, Cancer, Leo/*; but *Cancer/* is better than both the other. In *Virgo/* and *Libra/* they live of their daily labour from hand to mouth: little increasing or diminishing their store; unlesse they fall into the hands of Robbers, and then, without reskue, they lose all. \1. *In seven moneths the Bees spend of the stocke./*/ But in the other seven, either wholly or partly they feed upon that store, which the three rich moneths did afford them. For *Scorpio/* hath but the poore gleanings of decaying plants: the three still moneths nothing at all. *Pisces/* beginneth to put forth fresh plants, which in *Aries/* and *Taurus/* are well increased: but this breeding time the mouths are multiplied more often than the meat, which \*+Rainie, cold, and windie./*/ +unkinde weather oftentimes suffereth them not to fetch in. So that all this while, they, more or lesse, spend upon the stocke: yea the weaker stalls somewhat longer, being not so well able to indure the sharpe aire: and therefore, for want of some store to feed on betweene whiles at home, I have knowne some die after Mid-*Gemini./* 
\2. *Three sorts of swarmes diversely provided./*/ For which seven spending moneths, some swarmes are sufficiently provided: which you may reckon as Jewels, the verie *Spes gregis/*; whose increase the next yeere is certaine, if they be not over-hived. Some are not provided for halfe the time: and these, as desperately poore, are not worth the 
[cw: feeding.]

===
$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

feeding. Others are provided for six, or five, or foure moneths: which, by the helpe of feeding, may live and doe well. 
\3. *The first sort./*/ Of the first sort are timely prime swarmes unbroken: also faire Castlings not over hived, before *Cancer/*; yea and in kinde or backward Summers before *Mid-Cancer:/* when the black-bery-blossomes are not yet come, *v./* \*V.c./*5.*n./*11./ nor the hony-deawes gone: For such have sufficient both company and time, to make sufficient provision.
\4. *The second./*/ Of the second sort are the over-little and late swarmes, whose paucitie and povertie makes them unlustie to travell for more, and unable to keepe what is gotten or given them. Such are sure to bee put before winter be past, by cold and hunger, out of hunger and cold. And therefore if you have omitted to save such by *Union; v./* \*V.c.5.n.68./*/ yet omit not to save that little which they have, and your vaine labour and cost in feeding them. *v.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*3.*in III./*
\5. *The third onely are to be fed./*/ Of the third sort are midling and indifferent swarmes, which by their earnest labour have gotten well, and gathered good store of wealth together: but yet, for some want of number or time, the summer leaveth them in some want of provision. 
\6. *Stockes out of proofe never to be fed./*/ As for Stockes that have stood two yeeres, and yet have not sufficient stocke for these seven moneths; (whether they be such as have gotten it, or having gotten it have lost it againe) they are out of proofe: and therefore fit to be taken, not fed. *v.c./*10.*p./*1.*n.3.in III./*
\7. *Trie your swarmes in/* Virgo./ But because unkinde summers may make good warmes but poore, as contrarily a plentifull summer may much mend the worst; after *Mid-Virgo,/* when Bees are to be taken, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1*n./*2./ it behoveth you to trie all your swarmes, by knocking and poising them: for the noise will tell you the greatnesse of the company, and the weight, their wealth. They that are used to poise them by hand, will resolve you readily in this point by aime: which till you know to doe, the Scales may direct you. \8. *What quantitie of Hony is requisite./*/ For having taken the just weight of the Hive and all together, if, the fore-knowne weight of the leere spleeted Hive being deducted, there remaine not fifteene pound in all, to
[cw: wit,]

$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

wit, for five pound *v./* \*V+in.c.5.n.45./*/ in Bees, the double weight in honie and wax; that swarme is desperately poore, *v./* \*V.n./*2/ and fitter to be taken than fed+. If the swarme with his store doe weigh betweene fifteene and twentie, due feeding *v./* \*V.n.14,&c./* may save him. If betweene twentie and five and twentie, hee is able to shift for himselfe, and live without helpe. If betweene five and twenty and thirtie, esteeme him as right good, plentifully provided even for a hard winter, and fitted to be forward the next spring +. And above the greater the store is, the better increase it promiseth. Unlesse, in some extraordinarie yeere, the Hive be cloyed with too much: *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*3,*in VII.&VIII./*/ for too much as well to Bees as men, doth ofttimes more harme than good. 
+Yet they that have but a small Bee-fold, and are content to be often troubled (specially at the second feeding-time) may try those that lacke a pound or two of this weight.
+And yet such though never so good, will perish neverthelesse, if they chance to lose their Queene: *v./* \*V.c./*1.*n./*6.// which sometime happeneth to those that are much troubled in the hiving.*v.c./*5.*n./*52.
\9. *Trie againe in/* Pisces *or/* Aries./ Moreover, because a long winter and a rough spring following, with some other accidents, may waste them that were good, as, on the other side, a short winter and a milde spring may helpe those that were scantily provided; it shall not be amisse to try againe in *Pisces/* or *Aries,/* those that you suspect; and to feed them if you see cause.*v.n./*15.*&/*16.
\10. *The Bees food./*/ THE naturall food of Bees is Honie: for want, or sparing whereof, many other things have beene devised. *Aristotle/* mentioneth Figs, and all such sweet things. *Apiarii ficus ac reliqua ad genus dulcia cibum apponnut./* \Hist.li.9.*c./*40./ and *Plinie,/* speaking more particularly, commendeth Raysings, and Figs, and teased Wooll, wet in sweet Wine made of Raisings, or new Wine boiled, or Hony-water. \Nat hist.li.21.c.14./ *Si cibus deesse censeatur apibus, avas passas siccasue, sicosque, tusas ad fores earum posuisse conveniet, item lanas tractas madentes passo aut defruto, aut aqua mulsa./* And some of our Country-men have practised to give them Bay-salt, Bean-flower, Ground-mault, rosted Wardens, and Apples, and sweet Wort. All 
[cw: which]

===

$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

which things, though they will spend; yet cannot they be preseved by them without Honie. 

Touching the counsell of *Plinie./* this is to be noted, that if you place their food *ad fores/* before the doore, it will draw strange Bees unto them: whereby the lives of the one, and the goods of the other will be indangered: if you place it abroad from your Hive, then will it be common: and if within upon the stoole, which is best, then must you remove it in time, or keep it close: *v./* \*V.n./*11./ otherwise it will be no better for them, than if it were set *ad fores/*. And as for the device of teased Wooll, it is a fitter meanes to catch Bees, than to feed them. For if the liquor be above the Wooll, it will lime the wings of many; if not, many will be intangled in the small haires, as Birds in a grin. Cover it therefore with a linnen cloth, so that the Bees may not creepe betweene. 
\11. *Private feeding./*/ The manner of feeding Bees in their Hives is divers. Some give them Honie in a spoone: but that way many of them be-smeare their wings: and if their fellowes licke them not cleane presently, before the cold chill them, they die. Others, to avoid this inconvenience, give it them in a warme Toste: but this way wasteth the hony, & doth not altogether avoid the former inconvenience. Others have other devices. But indeed the only good way to feed Bees is with a combe, after this manner. First, take a fresh Combe of Live-honie out of a Hive, & lay it upon some Prop or stay, that the Bees may worke, as well under as upon. This Prop may be a woodden grate seven or eight inches square, made of two sides halfe an inch deepe, and three ribs fastened into them with Dove-railes, or with small nailes. For a need two severall square stickes may serve: but then you cannot so quickly either see it in, or take it out. 
Then in a faire calme evening (when the heat of the day, and the Bees worke is past) place this upon the stoole: so that the Feeding-combe be reared as neere the Hive-combes as may be, not touching them, lest the Bees fasten this and them together. Then see that the Hive, set downe in his place, be close every where: and at the doore but room enough for a Bee or two to passe. Then will these Bees to worke afresh, not ceasing day nor night untill they have rid the Combe cleane: which within eight and fortie houres will be effected. If they need any more, the next evening doe

===

$*Of the Feeding of Bees./*/$

likewise. But alwaies when it waxeth darke, and the Bees are all in; barre up the doore: and let them not out till the next evening, when other Bees are quiet. Or if you doe it in the morning, be sure also to take out the Combe, whether he be rid or no. And still leave the Hive close, with a narrow passage. 
\12. *Carelesse feeding is starving./*/ If your poore Bees should not be thus defended from strangers, the feeding of them would prove a starving of them. For the Borderers smelling the bootie will be sure to have part of it, if they can come at it: and when that is done, they will set upon the other, and so spoile all: as often it falleth out through this carelesnesse. Which causeth some to condemne all feeding of Bees, as painfull and fruitlesse: saying, If you feed them not, they can but die: and so will they doe when you have bestowed your labour and cost. But this is disproved by experience: for those, which being fit to be fed *v./* \*V.n./*50/ are thus fed, do seldome miscarrie. That summer they provide sufficiently for winter, and the next they are as likely to swarme and be fat as an other. 
\13. *Publike feeding./*/ You may also feed your poore swarmes, together, (if you have no neighour-Bees to beguile them) by setting any refuse-honie or leavings abroad in your Garden, having first barred up those that need it not. This feeding-Hony, as that which is stolne, when they have first taken their refection, they convey into their void Cells: which, because they cannot now shut them up, as before *Virgo,/* for want of wax; *v./* \*V.c./*6.*n./*15./ they doe but halfe-fill. And therefore they first spend of this last gotten hony, reserving that, which was more safely laid up, unto the last.  
\14. *The first time of feeding./*/ It is good to feed Bees before they need: (that they may save their store, which they have shut up in their Cells, until the spring) namely, in the later part of *Virgo,/* when the Combes are taken, *v./* \*V.c./*10.*p./*1.*n./*2./ or in *Libra./* For those that have spent their owne store, and have little or nothing leaft in the end of Winter, as so discouraged and so feeble with fasting; that knowing their thin bodies can beare out no cold, they wil not come abroad, but when they are fed: unlesse the weather be exceeding warme and calme: and the more they keepe in, the 
[cw: weaker]

===

weaker still they are, and lesse apt to breed. But those whose rathe feeding hath caused them to spare their store till the Spring, will be as cheerefull as the best: in any reasonable weather they will abroad, and fetch in that fruitfull *Ambrosia,/* which causeth them presently to increase and multiply. *v.c./*4.*n./*12.
At this first time therefore first finish the publike feeding: and then begin the private, specially of those that are under eighteene pound: to which if you give now the better part of their+ due allowance; you may supply the defects of them, as also the rest, at the second feeding-time, when their need will better appeare. 
+Their due allowance, first and last to be given them, is so much at least, as the swarme with his store lacketh of twentie pound. *v.n./*8. 
\15. *The second time of feeding./*/ In *Pisces/* or *Aries/*, as soone as the weather is warme (not before, lest the cold chill them in their worke) if you feare they will lacke, (which you may perceive by their lightnesse & unwillingnesse to come abroad) supply their want againe, and againe, if need be. But in this second feeding, for lacke of a Hony-combe, take a drie Combe, reserved for the purpose, and poure thereon so much Honie as it may receive. If you thinke it be not liquid enough; then either warme it first over the fire, or else spread it all over the Combe with your finger, that it may sinke into the Cells: (for which purpose Live-hony is best) then use this honied combe as the Hony-combe. *v.n./*11.
\16. *The third time of feeding./*/ If either these fed Bees, or any other, chance afterward to lacke (namely in *Taurus/*, or somwhat before or after) then feed them daily untill mid-*Gemini/*, giving them, everie evening or morning betimes, a spoonefull of Honie; and taking away the Combe againe before other Bees be at worke. But this is to be done without intermission: for the Bees will duly looke for it, and languish, if once or twice they lacke it. 
If you use to knocke the Hive, when you put in the Honie; they will come downe together, like sheepe to a call, when they are to be fodered.
By this meanes I have saved swarmes that forsooke their Hives for hunger, hiving them againe in their owne Hives: which proved good the same yeere.

##*Of the removing of Bees./*/##

\1. *Five things to be avoided in removing Bees./*/ [I]N removing of Bees be carefull to avoid these five evills: 1. hindering of their swarming: 2. and of their Hony-gathering: 3. breaking of their Combes: 4. robbing: 5. and losse of Bees. 
\2. *Remove alwaies in faire weather/*/ Remove alwaies in a faire day, and, as neere as you can guesse, in setled weather. For when they are moved to another place, if it be within their circuit or walke; they will flie to their old standing as soone as they are let goe, and hanker about it three or foure daies, and sometime longer: where if the cold wet catch them, many lose their lives. And if you remove them out of their knowledge, then, as amazed in an uncouth place, they flie about for a while viewing the countrie, and searching for their old home: when they are wearie, they rest wheresoever: and if foule weather come upon them, they are in like danger. 
\3. *Not in Winter./*/ For the time of the yeere, remove not in the three still moneths, or in a fortnight afore or after, for losing the Bees. For if foule weather fall not, the very still cold will kill many, while they are straying abroad: and of those that returne, being not yet acquainted with the Hive doore, some will fall short, some upon the Hive: where, while they rest panting, the cold chilleth them. 
\4. *Nor in Summer./*/ *Taurus, Gemini,/* and especially *Cancer,/* are naught, for hindering the swarming, as well as their hony-gathering: and *Cancer/* for danger also of breaking their soft Combes. 
In *Leo/* though the swarming time be past, and robbing time not yet come; yet there remaineth some honie-gathe-
[cw: ring,]

$*Of the Removing of Bees./*/$

ring, and the Combes being then most weightie and most weake, the danger of breaking them is greatest. 
To remove in *Virgo/* (when the Bees doe ever use to be trying of masteries) *v./* \*V.c.7.n.31./*/ is dangerous for robbing. For the *Indiginæ/* or old inhabitants of the Garden (as they goe about prying for booties) finding new neighbours come among them, will be sure to visit them: and while the chiefe of their strength is stragling abroad, seeking for their old dwelling; they will bring the rest such cheere to their house-warming, as shall haply make the house too hot for them. And then they must be faine to goe along with them, and helpe to carrie their owne goods after them. *v.c.7.n.42./*
\5. *The Autumne and Spring are fit times for removing./*/ The fittest time is either in *Libra/* and the fore-part of *Scorpio/*, that they may thoroughly know their new standing before the weather be too cold; or in *Aries/* and the later part of *Pisces,/* that they may be acquainted with it before much gathering of Honie. 
Neverthelesse, if you have Bees in other mens keeping, whose care and skill you mistrust; you were better to remove them unseasonably with some losse, than to hazard all by their ignorance and negligence.
\6. Libra, *the best moneth in all the yeere./*/ But if you may choose, remove in *Libra/* onely, which is simply the best.
\7. *When to remove a swarme./*/ And for the removing of a Swarme into an other Garden, (whether it be neere or far off) the only time is the evening or night next after the hiving: that he may be at his new standing, readie to worke, in the morning; and so lose no time, nor breake his first Combe in the carriage.
\8. *The time of the day, and manner of removing./*/ IN the evening, when you meane to remove, an houre before sun-set prop up the Hive from the Stoole, with three Bolsters two or three inches thicke, that the Bees may ascend from the stoole. About halfe an houre after, having prepared an other stoole of the same height, and covered it with your Mantle, so, that the middle of the mantle be over the middle of the stoole; move the stall with his stoole, if you may, a little aside; and set the covered stoole close
[cw: to]

to the old stoole, either beside it, or before it. This done, lift up the stall from his old stoole and set it upon the new: and then wiping the Bees from the old stoole (if any remaine) with your Brush; either take the stoole away, or cover it with a cloth. And then if your new stoole be onely a planke without legs, borne up by some other meanes; it is good to set it upon the old. Within a while when the Bees are all in, knit the mantle at the foure corners over the top of the Hive so as the knots may not slip: and presently binde it to the Hive about the middle slackly with a small line, and wrest it fast with a little sticke. And so is the stall readie to be removed.
\9. *The usuall manner of removing./*/ They use commonly to make no more adoe, but after sun-set when the Bees are at rest, to lift up the stall, and set it upon a mantle spread on the ground, and so to binde it up, leaving the Bees upon the stoole (which in a good stall are not a few) behinde them. \10. *Which is fit for poore stalles./*/ Which way, for such stalls as have all their Bees up in the Hive, may serve well enough.
\11. *How a good stall is to be carried./*/ The best way to carrie your+ Stall is upon a Cowl-staffe betweene two.
+If you have many to remoove; two lustie fellowes may beare two or three of them at once: but let them be all fast bound together.
\12. *How a bad./*/ If it be light, one may carrie it in his hand. But, howsoever, be sure it hang perpendicularly for feare of breaking the Combes; specially if you chance to remove before *Libra/*, when the waxe is soft and the lower parts of the Combes are heavie with Schadons, as well as the upper with Honie. 
\13. *What to doe when they are brought home./*/ When you have brought the Stall home, you may let it stand bound as it is, all night in the house. The morrow, when the weather serveth, set him on his seat: but if it be foule all the next day, keepe him still bound untill it be faire. And then having loosed the line, and taken away the Mantle, cloome him up presently: leaving, for three or foure faire daies, a verie narrow entrance, for feare of robbing. \14. *And what when they are seated./*/ For their new neighbours, even now also (though not so eagerly as in *Virgo/*) will prove them: and they will not so stoutly resist, untill they be acquainted in the place.

##*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/##

Wherein is shewed first the *Vindemiation/* or taking of the Combes: secondly the trying of the *Wax/* and *Honie/*, with the making of *Meth/* or *Hydromel/*: and thirdly, the singular vertues of them, for the use and comfort of man. 

*The first part of this Chapter sheweth the taking of the Combes./*
\1 *The first kind of Vindemiation/*/ {T}He most usuall, and generally most usefull manner of taking of the Combes, is by killing the Bees. For which the naturall and seasonable time is the latter part of *Virgo/*, from the end of the *Dog-daies/* unto *Libra/*: because till then the Combes are full of Schadons, which deceive the Honi-men, making the Hive heavier and the Honie worse: (for the young Bees as well as the Coome corrupt the same, \2. *The best time for killing Bees./*/ *Pulli & rubra sordes sunt mals saporis, & succi suo mella corrumpunt./* \Col.l.9.c.15/ and after that time, the weather waxeth colder, not so fit for the running and working of the Honie: and the Honie is likely to decrease, either by their owne spending or by the spoiling of Robbers. Except in the heath-countries, where their gathering lasteth longer: for there they defer their taking untill Mid-*Libra./*
\3 *What Stalls are to be taken./*/ At this time therefore consider with your selfe what Stalls you wil kill. Swarmes that may live, yeerlings, and two yeerlings that are in proofe, keepe for store. Likewise those that rid their Drones betimes, and specially those that draw out their young Cephens. *v./* \*V.c.4.n.31.&32./*/ Those of three or foure yeeres, which, by reason of their not swarming this last summer, are 
[cw: ful]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

full of Bees, lightly are fat, and therefore worth the taking: but they are also good for store, unlesse the frequent Honi-dewes have made them over fat. But those of that age which have cast twice (except they were very forward and had beat away their Drones betimes) are they not likely to+ continue, and therefore are to be taken. 
+If you would have any such to stand an other yeere, and not to bee weakened by his late castling; put it backe into the stocke againe, *v.c.5.n.11./*
Likewise all poore swarms unworthy to be fed, *v./* \*v.c./*8.*n./*4./ and all light stocks whose stocks are decayed: *v./* \*V.c.8.n.6./*/ For they will surely die. Neither is it safe to trust any after they have stoode five yeeres: unlesse it be some speciall kinde of Bees, which cast often, and yet beating away their Drones betimes, doe still keepe themselves in heart. For such I have kept nine or ten yeeres: and I have heard of some of a greater age. Moreover, all stalls of three yeeres old and upward, that have mist swarming two yeeres together: and especially those, that having lyen forth the summer before, did not cast this last summer: for such doe seldome after prosper. It is therefore better to take them now while they are good, than in a vaine hope of increase, to keep them till they perish. Likewise if you have any that are very fat and full of Honie, (as some yeeres some will be, even down to the Stoole) those are ripe and ready to yeeld their fruit. One such is worth three or foure. Take them therefore in their season: For wanting roome to breed in (their Cells being full of Honie) they will decay by little and little, and consume to nothing. And therefore, as in a wet hungry yeere you must keepe the best, so in a drie yeere, rich and plentifull in Honie-dewes, the worst are like to prove best for store. 
But generally take the best, and the worst. *In medio virtus./* And ever suspect those that rid not their Drones in time, *v./* \*V.c.4.n.30./*/ 
Also those which the Robbers doe eagerly assault, *v./* \*V.c.3.n.50./*/ and if their Combes bee once broken, *v./* delay not their taking.   
\4 *The manner of killing Bees/*/ Having made choice of your Stall to be taken, some two or three houres before + Sun-set dig a hole in the ground, as neere the Stoole as may bee, about eight or nine inches 
[cw: deepe]

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$


deepe and almost as wide as the Hive-skirts: laying the small earth round about the brims. Then having a litte-sticke slit in one end, & shript at the other, take a + Brimstone-match 5. or 6. inches long, and about the bignesse of your little finger, and making it fast in the slit, sticke the sticke in the middle or side of the hoale; so that the top of the Match may stand even with the brim of the pit: and then set another by him drest after the same manner, if that bee not sufficient. When you have fired these Matches at the upper ends, set over the Hive: and presently shut it so close at the Skirts, that none of the smoake may come forth. So shall you have the Bees dead and downe in lesse than a quarter of an houre. 
+That you may have the evening and morning to finish your worke; while the store-Bees be at rest: which otherwise will trouble you in handling the Honie, if by any meanes they may come at you. But if the weather be cold enough to keepe them in, or the house bee close enough to keepe them out; you may take whay time of the day you please. 
+Matches are made of linnen rags and Brimstone, after the manner that maids make Sluts. First, melt pounded Brimstone: then take a linnen rag a foot long, and holding both the ends in one hand, dip the rest in the melted Brimstone, turning it up and downe with a sticke: then taking one of the ends in the other hand, winde it a little; for hard winding makes it burne the worse. This cut in the middle maketh twaine. 
\5. *Sundry meanes to kill Bees./*/ Next unto Brimstone is the smoake of Bunt or great Puc-fists, Tuchwood, or Mushrums, used in like manner: but they are neither so quicke, nor so sweet. And for a need, some smother them with danke Straw, or Hay: but then the Honie will smell of the smoake. And therefore some drowne them in a Tub of water: but that hurteth the Honie, and doth the Hive no good: and, besides that, many of the Bees being not quite dead, will sting them that handle the Honie. 
\6. *The Bees being dead, house the Hive./*/ The Bees being dead, carrie the Hive into the house, &c. *See Part 2./* If any Bees escape, they will die that night: but if you feare they will doe any harme, you may kill them presently upon the Stoole. 
\7. *The second kinde of Vindemiation./*/ ANother way to take the Combes is by Driving the Bees. The maner of it is this. At Mid-summer, or wihin two or three daies after, in a faire morning an houre before Sun-

rising, lift the Stall from the Stoole, and set it upright and fast on the ground in a Brake *v./* \*V.c.5.n.24./*/ \8. *The time and manner of Driving Bees./*/ with the bottome upward: and quickly cover it with an emptie Hive, having first laid two spleets upon the full Hives bottome, that the emptie Hive may stand the faster. Then wrapping a Mantle *v./* \*V.c.5.n.48./*/ round about the Chincke or meeting of both the Hives, and binding it fast with a small cord above and beneath, that a Bee may not get forth, clap the full Hive or *Remover/* round about a good many times, pawsing now and then a little betweene, that the Bees may ascend into the void Hive. And when you thinke that most of them are driven up (which will bee about half an houre after) set the upper Hive or *Receiver/* upon the old stoole: BUT bee sure &c. *as it followeth note/* 15.
Provided alwaies, before you goe about this businesse, that all the Stalls in your Garden be first shut up, lest they trouble you and your poore Bees.  
\9. *This driving of Bees unprofitable./*/ This kinde of taking is much applauded at the first, because men thinke thereby to save both Bees and Honie: but it falleth out with them as it is in the Proverbe, *All covet, all lose./* For the Honie is neither so good, as being not yet in season, and to bee corrupted with the Schadons, *v./* \*V.n.2./*/ which can hardly be cleane taken from it; neither so much by almost the one halfe, sith there remaine yet six or seven weekes of Honie-gathering. 
\11. *And the Bees driven, few and poore./*/ And the Bees, as men forcibly driven from their goods and children, are so discouraged, that they seldom thive after it: specially those that have swarmed; seeing their companie is leaft but small, and the after-brood is destroyed, which should have supplyed the roomes of them that are gone. And as for those that have not cast, they might after that time yeeld a swarme, which would be better than the whole stall being driven: and if they did not swarme at all, they would they bee so much the better, either to take for Honie, or to keepe for store. *v.c.5.n.22./* 
\12. *Another kinde of driving/*/ This Driving of Bees into leere Hives being nothing so profitable as it seemeth, I doe rather commend unto you the Driving of one stall into another: whereby the fruit of one 
[cw: is]

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

is taken and the lives of both are saved together. 
\13. *At two times./*/ And thus some are to be driven in the latter part of *Virgo,/* when they have done breeding, *v./* \*V.n.2./*/ and some in *Aquarius/* or *Pisces,/* before they begin to breed againe. *v.c.4.n.12./* 
\14. *Driving in/* Virgo./ In *Virgo/* such stalls onely are to be driven, as are fit to bee killed. *v./* \*V.n.3./*/ and that into yeerlings or two-yeerlings, which that yeere have cast twice, and therefore have few Bees leaft in them; but yet have Honie enough. 
\15. *The manner of driving in/* Virgo./ The manner of it is this. 
Having first placed these two stalles, the *Remover/* that is driven, and the *Receiver,/* as neere as may be one to another, and so let them stand together six or seaven daies, til they be well acquainted with their standings; when you see the weather being faire and constant, late in an evening, about ten a clocke, set the *Remover/* fast on the ground in a Brake, *v./* \*V.c.n.24./*/ and the *Receiver/* upon: and binde them close together, as in the former driving. And then, by often clapping the *Remover/* betweene your hands about the space of a quarter of an houre (now and then pawsing betweene) having driven most of the Bees into the *Receiver,/* and so mingled them all together; let them so stand til the morning. In the morning about Sun-rising, if the weather bee faire; (otherwise you must stay + longer) doe the like: having first shut and covered the other stalls, *v.c.5.n.25./*
+If the weather fit not the next day, you may safely stay till it doe fit; so that no Bees get forth in the meane space.  
This done, set the *Receiver/* upon the *Removers/* stoole: BUT, be sure to bolster him up with three Tile-shardes, that the driven Bees may easily get into the Hive on every side. And then knocke the *Remover/* downe upon the Table two or three foot square, set close to the forepart of the stoole: and, by clapping of the Hive, presently get as many of the Bees forth as you can. And forthwith carry the *Remover/* about a Pearch from the stoole: and there laying him downe, so that the Combes may lie edgelong, after a little while clap him twice or thrice, which will make many of the Bees to fly forth. Then remove him to another place about the former distance, and there doe likewise: and so to an other, and an other, untill few or no Bees will come forth by this meanes
[cw: And]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

And ever when you be come to a new place, and there have got out some Bees; leave there the *Remover/* and goe directly to the *Receiver,/* and a little beyond: for the Bees will follow you, and thereby the sooner recover the Hive. 
After this, having removed the *Receiver/* againe, and laid him with the Combes edglong as before; stay till you see the Bees ascended to the highest part of the Combes in the Skirt of the Hive: and then resting it on the edge of a Kiver, and turning the Bees toward your readiest hand; with two or three claps force them out into the Kiver: and then suddenly carry the Hive to an other place: and when you see more bees ascended, have it backe to againe to the Kiver, and there clap them out as before. This iterate as often as you see any store arise unto the upmost part of the Hive-skirt. Which when they cease to doe, the Hive is well nigh rid of his Bees. Betweene whiles, carrie the Kiver to the stall, and knocke out the Bees upon the Table. Then, having first loosed the spleets ends, take out the Combes, beginning at one side: and ever when you have taken out a Combe, wipe off the Bees with a fether of a Goose wing into the Kiver, and send it in, out of their sight. When the Combes are all gone, set the Hive and Kiver before the *Receiver,/* that the Bees may take up your leavings. As soone as they begin to bee quiet, take away the Bolsters, and cloome up the Hive very close, leaving the doore no wider than must needs bee. And when all is done, set open your other stalls: and carry the Hive and Kiver from among the Bees.
\16. *How to help those driven Bees that want./*/ If you thinke there be not sufficient provision for this double Stall in that single Hive, bestow a full Combe or twaine, *v./* \*V.c./*8*n./*11./ as need requireth, of the *Removers/* upon them: and thus will your Bees delight and prosper in new Wax, which in olde corrupt Combes would decay.
\27. *Driving in Pisces./*/ In *Aquarius/* or *Pisces,/* when you have poised your Hives, those that you find by their lightnesse, unlikely to indure the Spring for lacke of food, you may in like manner drive into such provided Stalls, as have fewest Bees: and so wil those *Receivers/* be much the better, and cast both the rather, and the greater Swarmes. And if by chance, at any time after,
[cw: you]

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

you find a Stall decayed, thus may you save them. Otherwise, if he be fit to be fed (*v.c.8.n.5./*) feed him, *v.c/*.8.*n./*15. and 16.
\18. *How to revive those that are chilled in driving./*/ If, the weather being not warme, you finde some Bees chilled about the Hive; fill your warme hands full of them, and anone they will flie away to their fellowes. *v:/* \*V.c.7.n.63./*/ And if haply any chance to pricke you, (which they will seldom doe) your hand will have the more vertue to revive the rest. 
This driving will not bee so troublesom as the former, because the poore Bees will easily change their hungry home for a place of plentie. 
\19. *A third kind of Vindemiation./*/ Exsection or Castration, is a third kinde of taking: which is the cutting out of part of the Combes, part being leaft for the Bees provision. And this was to be done at two times in the yeare,+ *In ortu, & occasu Vergiliarum/*.
\20 *Exsection used at two times./*/ *Virgiliarum ortus/* after *Columella,/* l.9.c.14. is the eight and fortieth day from *Æquinoctium vernum/*: after *Var./*: the foure and fortieth: but then you must understand that they accounted the *Æquinoctium/* to bee in the eight degree of *Aries:/* (although *Hipparchus/*, as *Columella/* saith, had then found it to be the first) With us the Cosmicall rising of *Vergiliæ/* or *Pleiades/* being seven starres in the neck of *Taurus/*, and in the four and twentieth degree of that signe, is knowne to be in the third of May, the five and fiftieth day after the true *Æquinoctium/*: which jumpeth with the account of *Columella./* And *Vergiliarum occasus/*, being in the same degree of the opposite signe, is upon the fift day of November.
\21. *What part to be exsacted is uncertaine./*/ But what part is to be taken, and what leaft, I find it not determined. *Priore messe/* (saith *Columella/*) *dum adhuc rura pastionibus abundant, quinta pars favorum; posteriore, cum jam metuitur hyems, tertia relinquenda est./*\l.9.*c/*.15/ But *Varro/* then requireth for their store two third parts; *Ut ne plus tertia pars eximatur mellis, reliquum hyemationi relinquatur/*. And *Aristotle/* because (as *Columella/* granteth) *hic modus non est in omnibus regionibus certus/*; doth not prescribe any certaine part, but leaving it to the discretion of the Bee-master, saith, *Cum favos apiarii eximunt, cibi tantum relinquant, quantum per hymem sufficiat: quod si satis sit, servatur examen; sin minus, vel moritur ibidem, (sine discedat hyems obstet) vel de serit sedem, si serenum nanciscitur./*

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$


\22. *Exsection ancient, but not profitable./*/ This way of taking, as appeareth, was anciently used in plentifull Countries, as *Greece, Sicily, Italy,/* &c. \23. *Neither first./*/But the former exsection, to wit, in the Spring, *Aristotle/* no where mentioneth: and surely it must needs doe more harme then good, seeing the Hives are then full of Schadons which being spild, spill their swarming; and the store of Honie, which they seeke for, is then well spent. 
\24. *Nor second./*/ And that also in the Autumne (which yet is the fitter time) seemeth no lesse unprofitable then troublesom: because the Bees, in the Spring following, if they lacke not Honie to live on, yet shall they lacke Cells to lay their young in, whereby their breed will bee hindered. And at neither time can it be done without much spoile of Bees. 
\25. *Specially for our Country./*/ But howsoever it faied with them, for our Country I take it to be verie unfitting. And therefore I say the lesse of it: referring the curious Reader unto the fifteenth Chapter of the ninth Booke of *Columella,/* and unto *Georgius Pictorious,/* who in his fourteenth Chapter writeth thereof at large. 
*The second part of this Chapter sheweth the trying of (1) Honie and (3) Wax with the (2) making of/* Meth *or/* Hydromel.

{T}HE hive being housed, *v:/* \*V.p.1.n.6./*/ squat it softly against the ground, upon the sides, not the edges of the Combes: and loosing the ends of the Spleets with your fingers, and the edges of the Combes, where they sticke to the sides of the Hive, with a woodden Slice; take them out one after an other. 
\1. *The Combes to be divided into three parts./*/ Then having wiped off the halfe-dead Bees with the Feather of a Goose-wing, breake the Combes presently, while they are warme, into three parts: the first sheere Honie and Wax, the second Honie and Wax with Sandarach, the third dry Wax without Honie. And that they may breake right where you would have them, marke the places deeply with the edge of your knife. 
\2. *Necessarie Instruments being first provided./*/ But first provide necessarie Instruments, as Panns, Kivers, Tongs, wide Sieves, or Wheat-ridders, a Slice, Knives, Straining-bagges, a Tub or Kieve, with a Tap, and 
[cw: Tap-waze,]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

Tap-waze, a hairen Clensieve,+ Honie-pots, Wax-moulds, Meth-barrels, &c.
+Treene vessels, if they leake not, are better than earthen: which if they breake not by some mischance, the verie force of the Honie is able to cracke. 
These things provided, take out the first Combe: and setting the Honie-end in a Ridder, resting upon Tongs over a cleane Pan or Kiver that will not leake; marke and breake off the first part for Honie, and leave it there: then going to the Kieve fitted with a Tap and Tap-waze, marke and break off the second part for Meth or Hydromel, and leave it there: and lay the third part aside for Wax. Then taking out an other Combe doe the like, &c. till the Ridder be full. 
\3. *The dressing of the first part for Honie in two shoots./*/ 
If you meane to make two shoots, and so two sorts of Honie; let your assistant presently cut the first part into thin slices, and, without any more adoe, let the Honie runne his first shoot. \4. *The first shoot for fine ordinary Honie./*/ But this is to be understood of the darker part of the Combes: for the pure white Cells in the upper part (which containe nothing but pure white, or yellowish Live Honie) you may as well crush betweene your hands: and this will be fine ordinarie Honie. 
\5.*Or for Virgin-Honie, which is most fine./*/ But if, for some speciall use, you would have some Honie yet more fine and pure; then onely slice the purer part of the Combes, being yet warme with the temperate heat of the Bees, and so let the pure Live-honie runne through a cleane Clen-sieve. For, *In omni melle quod per se fluit (ut mustum oleumque) appellaturque acæton, maxime laudabile est./*. \Nat. hist.l.II.c.15./ Of all Honie that which runneth of it selfe, (as new Wine and Oile) and is called +*Acœton/* is most commendable. 
This *Acœton/* or finest *Nectar/*, for his incorrupted puritie, is called Virgin-Honie. *Quod è favis sponte primum de fluit, virgineum mel vulgo appellatur./* Plantinus in Fernel.l.7.de Meth.Med.
\6. *Two sorts of virgin-honie./*/ Whereof there are two sorts. The right Virgin-honie is of a Swarme: *v./* \*V.c.6.n.29./*/ that which is of an old Stall, though it runne first and of it selfe, and were gathered the same yeare; yet being partly mixt with other, and laid up in corrupter vessels, not in the pure Virgin-Cells, *v:/* \*V.c.9.n.14./*/ is but a second or 
[cw: bastard]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$

bastard Virgin-honie, rather to be called the finest ordinary. *v.c.6.n.30./*
+*Acœton/* without drosse or dregges. For [Greek] doth properly signifie *Cubilo/* a Bed, and is here used for Dregges, because the Dregges of Wine and Oyle and such liquors, are as a Bed or *Ground/* whereon they *lye:/* in which respect we also call them *Lees/* or *Grounds/*. But this *Metaphor/* to the Dregs of Honie is somewhat Catachrestical: because the Honie beareth his Drosse, and not the Drosse the Honie. 
\7. *Corne-honie got out by water or fire./*/ But the hard Corne-honie *v:/* \*V.c.6.n.27.&28./*/ in the top of the Combes, specially if there be any store, because it will not runne, you must either wash into the warme Meth-liquor; or melt it with the Cells on a soft fire, or in a hot oven, or in *Balneo Mariæ, v:/* \*V.p.3.n.7./*/ and so shall you have the Honie by it selfe, and the Wax swimming above it: which you may take away when it is cold. But so this good Honie will become but course: and therefore put it to the second shoot. 
Having now taken so many Stalls as you can dresse this evening, *v:/* \*V.ibidem./*/ take the rest as soone after as you may, *v:/* \*V.+in p.1.n.4./*/ and let the Honie be all tryed out, before you soake the second part. 
The Hives being rid, carrie them into your Garden (a Pearch at least from any Stall) for the Bees to take up your leavings: *v:/* \*V.c.8.n.13./*/ And have still by you a paile of faire water to wash your hands in: which water must be for the Meth.
When the Honie hath runne what it will; put this first shoot, whether it be ordinarie or Virgin-honie, into a picked bag, to straine it into his pot by it selfe. \8. *The second shoot for course Honie./*/ And let the remainder bee crusht with warme hands that it may runne againe for a second sort, which is likewise to be strained. That which is leaft at the last, in the Bags, Ridders, and else-where, wash into the second shoot of the Must *v:/* \*V.n.17./*/ to give it his just strength. 
The weather being not warme, set the Honie by the fire to helpe the running. 
\9. *The dressing of the first part in one shoot./*/ Otherwise if you be in haste, and meane to make but one sort of Honie; first slice off the upper part of the Combe (even as much as you finde void of Sandarach) for Honie: and presently let your assistant worke all together with warme hands, and so make but one shoot, which afterward

is to be strained. *v:/* \*V.n.7./*/ Then going to the Kive, slice off the second part (even all that hath Honie) for Meth. And set aside the drie part for Wax. And thus will your Honie be good enough: and such as, compared with the vulgar Honie, may well goe for fine. 
\10. *The vulgar Honie grosly handled./*/ For the Honie-men (because thus to cut each Combe into divers parts, and diversly to dresse each part, would be too tedious to them that have much to doe) doe use to make but one worke of all; with a thin light shovell pounding and compounding the Honie, and Wax, and Bees, and Schadons, and Sandarach all together. And then putting this confused stuffe into a strong hairen Bag, doe with a Presse or Wrenge violently wring out all that will runne. And this, having first his season of heat over the fire, they put up into barrels or other vessels to worke: whereby though it bee much purged, yet can it not choose but participate the nature and taste of those things wherewith it was so thoroughly infected. This done, the Pulse remaining in the Bagge they slice with a shredding-knife into a Trough or other vessel, and all-to-wash it and mash it in faire water for Mede: which, when the sweetnesse is all washt out, being crushed dry, the balls they try for Wax. 
\11. * The working of Honie, and how to helpe it./*/ Honie being put up warme into pots, will in two or three daies worke up a skum of Wax, Honie, and Drosse together: which being taken off with a spoone, put to the second part. In cold weather the Honie will not worke well without the heat of the fire. The best way is to put it into an oven after the batch is forth, but not before you can abide to hold your hand upon the bottom, for feare of over-heating the Honie. The next way is to stirre it in *Balneo Maria, v:/* \*V.p.3.n.7./*/ till it be all warme. 
\12. *Divers Countries yeeld divers kinds of Honie./*/ The differences and degrees of Honie in goodnesse, are as well naturall as artificiall. For as it is made better or worse by the ordering and handling of it; so is it in it selfe better or worse, according to the different condition of the soile where it is gathered. *v./* \*V.c.6.n.31./* The Champian-honie is accounted almost twice as good as the Heath-honie, although they bee ordered both alike. For when the vulgar champian is sold 
[cw: for]

for nine pound the Barrell, the like Heath-honie will scarce yeeld five. And generally the finer the Wheat and the Wooll is, the finer the Honie of the same Region: *v./* \*V.p.3.n.4.&c.6.n.31./*/ and therefore no marvaile that the course Heath, hath as course Honie as Wooll.
*13. How to know good Honie/*/ Good Honie, when it hath wrought, hath these properties whereby it is knowne: It is cleere, odoriferous, yelow like pale gold, (but right Virgin-honie is more crystalline at the first, *v./* \*V.c.6.n.29/*/) sharpe, sweet, and pleasant to the taste, of a meane consistence betweene thicke and thinne, so clammie, that beeing taken up upon your fingers end, in falling it will not part, but hang together like a long string, as that useth to doe which is clarified. And such doth *Jacobus Sylvius/* describe the best honie, *Meloptimum sit purum adeo ut totum per luceat, odorum, flavum, acerrimum, dulcissimumque gustanti & jucundissimum, consistentia nec crassa nec liquida, sed tam sibi cohærens ut continuitatem suam, quasi linea longissima, non intercisum servet, si digito attollitur: idem coquendo paucam spumam emittit./* And *Guil.Plantius. Mel probum est quod inter crassissimum & tennissimum, sit mediocre, sapore dulcissimum, & acerimum, simulque dulcedinis sensum inferens & vellicatu pungens linguam, colore pallidum aut subrutulum, & pellucidum, odoratissimum & recentissimum; quodque sublatum non facile ob sequacem lentorem abrumpatur, pondere grave, & inter coquendum spumæ parum emittens./* In Fern. l.7.de Oxymel. 
\14. *Good Honie with standing waxeth hard and white/*/ This good Honie, specially that part which is in the bottom, will in time grow (like unto Corne-honie, *v./* in the uppermost part of the Combes) hard and white: such as is the Honie of + *Spaine/* and *Narbona/* in *France,/* which is accounted the chiefest, and compared with that of + *Hymettus/* and *Hybla./* But this is to be understood of ordinarie Honie: for the pure Virgin Honie will bee neither hard nor white; but changeth his liquiditie and crystalline cleernesse *v./* \*V.c.6.n.29./*/ into a thicke softnesse, and bright yelow colour. 
*+Quin Hispani & Narbonenses mittunt albissimum & longe præstantissimum, idemque; prædurum./* Sylv.l.I.med.

\15. *The best of the Honie is in the bottome./*/ And alwaies the best part of all Honie is that which is lowest in the vessell. + For as the best oyle is in the top, and the best wine in the middle; so the best Honie is in the bottom. *Mellis exilior pars fluitat, quæ eximenda est: pura vero & valida subsidit./* Arist.Hist.ani.l.9.c.40. *In imo vase quod sidit, supernatante pretiosius./*Plan.in Fern.l.7.de Oxymel.
+ As among liquors Oyle excelleth in lightnesse, and Honie in heavinesse; so in both that part is best, which excelleth in his excelling qualitie: and Wine being of a midling weight, is best in the middle. 
The weight of these three, one to an other, hath this proportion. Oile is not so heavie as Wine by one tenth part: for if you fill a measure with Wine, and divide it into ten parts; the same measure of Oile is no heavier then nine of them. And Honie is heavier than Wine by the halfe: for if you fill a measure with Wine, the same measure of Honie will weigh that and halfe so much more. *Quoniam Oleum levius est Vino parte + \+Ceu potius decima./ nonâ, Mel vero gravius Vino parte dimidia; quæounque mensura capit Mellis uncias quindecim, capit Vini uncias decem, & Olei novem./* Fern.Meth.l.4.c.6. 
\16. *The dressing of the second part for Meth./*/ THe second part of the Combes, appointed for Hydromel or Meth, you must first rid of the sandarach as neere as you can: cutting off that which is by it selfe, and + picking out that which is among the Honie: all which refuse, because of the wax that is with it, cast to the third part.
+If thus to part the Honie and the drosse shall seeme but a tedious piece of worke; you may leave it unto them that are expert in it *V.c.8.n.13./* And make your Meth of more meere Honie.  
\17. *How to make the Meth-liquor in two shoots./*/ And then, when the Honie is all strained, and put up; lay this second part a soake in milk-warme faire water, (that which commeth from heaven is counted best) in the Kive or Tub with his Tap and Tap-waze. But first wash the drie Combs therein, if any Honie chance to sticke unto them in the handling: then scrape and wash the Spleets, and lay them aside out of the way: and lastly, crush all the Pulse well betweene your hands, specially that which lieth lowest, and stirring is about all-to-wash it: and so let it steepe all that night.

In the morning let this first shoot of the Must or Woort, being made of his just strength, *v:/* \*V.n.19.&24./*/ runne through the Tap-Waze.  The Pulse which remaineth, when you have squeezed out the liquor, breake and wash in fresh warme water in the Kive, for a second shoot. When it hath lien a while in soake, first take those parcels that swim, and squeezing out the liquor +betweene your hands, lay the balls aside to the third part: (but let your Bees have the perusing of them) then take up those that lie in the bottome, and doe likewise: which because they have most Honie, you must take most paines in washing and crushing them. \*The second shoot./*/ And while this is doing, let this small liquor runne into a vessell by it selfe. When it is out, wash into it all the remainders of Honie *v:/* \*V.n.8./*/ adding some course Honie, if need be, to make it of his just strength: *v:/* and then let both shoots run together through a +Clensieve into the Kive againe. And thus shall you lose none of your Honie.  
+If there be much Pulse, use a presse, when the liquor hath runne what it will. 
+The Clensieve is unto the Tap-waze for Methe, as the Strainer to the Ridder for Honie.*v:n.7./*
\18. *Two sorts of Hydromel, Mede and Metheglen./*/ *Meth/* or *Hydromel/* is of two sorts: the weaker and the stronger, *Mede/* and *Methæglen./*
\19. *When the liquor is strong enoug for Mede./*/ For the making of *Mede/*, if the Must, when it is all together, be not strong enough to beare an Egge the bredth of a two-pence above it, then put so much of your course Honie into it as will give it that strength: which is sufficient for ordinary *Mede./* And afterward untill night, ever now and then stirre it well about the Kive. 
\20. *What proportion of water to hony./*/ If you would make a greater quantitie, then must you adde a proportionable measure of water and Honie: namely six of that for one of this. The learned Physitian *Mathias de Lobel/* requireth this proportion of six to one to be boiled to foure. His receipt of Spices is Cinamom, Ginger, Pepper, Graines, Cloves, *Ana/* two drammes. The second morning put to the Must the scum of the Honie, stirre all together, and stoope the Kive a little backward. When it

hath setled an houre or two, draw it out to be boiled. And when you see the grounds beginne to come, stay; and let the rest (save the very thick grounds, which cast to your Bees) runne into some vessell by it selfe: which, when it is setled, peere out into the boiling vessell through the Clensieve, and cast out these grounds also into your Garden. 
\21. *How, and how long the Must must be boyled./*/ The Must being set over a gentle fire, when you see the Scum gathered thicke all over, and the bubbles at the side begin to breake it; having slacked the fire, to cease the boyling, skim it cleane. Then presently make a fresh fire to it: and when you see the second skum ready, having + slacked the fire againe, take it quickly away: then make to it the third fire, and let it boyle to the wasting of a fourth part, if it bee made of the washing of Combes; and to the wasting of one fift or sixt part, if it be made of cleane Honie: not ceasing in the meane space to take off the Scum as cleane as you can. One houres boyling may suffice: but if the Meth bee of cleane Honie, it may as well be done in halfe the time. 
+ In stead of twice slacking the fire, you may twice coole the boyling Must with cold Must reserved: or else be sure that it doe boyle all the while onely at one side, and not all over. 
\22. *A receipt of Spices./*/After all this, put in the spices, *viz./* to a dozen gallons of the skimmed Must Ginger one ounce, Cinamom halfe an ounce, Cloves and Mace *Ana/* two drams, Pepper and Graines *Ana/* one dramme, all grosse-beaten, the one halfe of each being sowed in a bag, the other loose: and so let it boile a quarter of an houre more. 
The end of boiling is thoroughly to incorporate the Boorne and the Honie, and to purge out the drosse: which being once done, any longer boiling is unprofitable; as diminishing more than the quantitie, than increasing the strength and goodnesse of the Hydromel.
\23. *How the Must is to be used when it is boyled./*/ As soone as it is boiled enough, take it from the fire, and set it a cooling: the next day, when it is setled, poure it out, through a Haire-sive or linnen bag, into the Kive: (reserving still the Lees for the Bees) and there let it stand covered three or foure daies till it worke; and let it worke two daies,

Then draw it through the Tapwaze, and tun it into a Barrell scalded with Bay-leaves, making the Spice-bag fast at the tap. If there remain much grounds, you may purifie them by boiling and skimming againe as before: but this will never be so good as the first: and therefore you may put it by it selfe, or with some remainder of the best, into a small vessell to spend first, before it be soure. If the *Meth/* be not much, you may tun it the next day, and let it worke in the Barrell. Being tunned, it will in time be covered with a mother: which if, by jogging the vessell, or by other meanes, it be broken; the *Meth/* will turne soure. But so will it make excellent Vinegar, and the sooner, if it be set in the Sun: which the longer you keepe, the better it will be.     
\24. *The making of/* Methæglen./ *Metheglen/* is the more generous or stronger *Hydromel:/* being unto *Mede/* as *Vinum/* to *Lora./* For it beareth an Egge the breadth of a groat or six pence: and is usually made of finer hony, with a lesse proportion of water; namely, foure measures for one: receiving also in the composition as well certaine sweet and holsome hearbs, as also a larger quantitie of spices: namely, to everie halfe Barrell or sixteene Gallons of the skimmed Must, Eglantine, Majoram, Rose-marie, Time, Winter-favourite, *ana/* halfe an ounce; and Ginger two ounces, Cinamom one ounce, Cloves and Mace *ana/* halfe an ounce, Pepper, Graines, *ana/* two drams, the one halfe of each being bag'd, the other boiled loose. So that whereas the ordinarie *Mede/* will scarce last halfe a yeere; good *Methelglen/* the longer it is kept, the more delicate and holsome it will be: and withall the cleerer and brighter, according to the *Etymon/* of the name. *v. + in p.3.n.23./*
He that listeth to know the many and sundry makings of this holsome drinke, must learne it of the ancient *Britaines:/* who therein doe passe all other people. One excellent receit I will here recite: and it is of that which our renowmed Queene of happie memorie did so well like, that she would everie yeere have a vessell of it.  
\25. *The Queenes/* Methæglen./ First, gather a bushell of Sweete-briar-leaves, and a bushell of Tyme, halfe a bushell of Rose-marie, and a pecke of Bay-leaves. Seeth all these, being well washed in a Furnace of

faire water: let them boile the space of halfe an houre, or better: and then poure out all the water and herbes into a Vate, and let it stand till it be but milk-warme: then straine the water from the herbes, and take to everie+ six Gallons of water one Gallon of the finest Honie, and put it into the Boorne, and labour it together halfe and houre: then let it stand two daies, stirring it well twice or thrice each day. Then take the liquor and boile it anew: and when it doth seeth, skim it as long as there remaineth any drosse. When it is +cleere put it into the Vate as before, and there let it be cooled. You must then have in a readinesse a Kieve of new Ale or Beere, which as soone as you have emptied, suddenly whelme it upside downe, and set it up againe, and presently put in the *Methæglen,/* and let it stand three daies a working. And then tun it up in Barrels, tying at everie Tap-hole, by a Pack-thread, a little bag of Cloves and Mace, to the value of an ounce. It must stand halfe a yeere before it be drunke.  
+If you marvell that so great a quantitie of water is required; it is partly because of the goodnesse of the Honie, which being pure and fine goeth further than ordinarie: and partly that it may have the longer time in boiling, before it come to his strength. And therefore some will have eight parts of water to one of Honie: but then they boile it so much the longer.
+The third part at least being wasted.  
\26. *The dressing of the third part for Wax./*/ THE third Part consisting of wax and drosse, set over the fire in a Kettle or Caldron that may easily containe it: and poure into it so much water as will make the wax to swim, that it may boile without burning: and for this cause, while it is seething with a soft fire, stir it often. \27. *First boile it with water./*/ When it hath sod a while and is thoroughly melted, take it off the fire, and presently poure it out of the Kettle into a Strainer of thin strong Linnen, or of Twisted-haire, readie placed upon a Wrenge or Presse: and then winding and doubling the necke of the Bag, lay on the Cover and presse out the liquor as long as any Wax commeth into a Kiver of cold water, but first wet therewith both the Bag and the Presse, to keepe the Wax from sticking. At the first commeth forth most water, at the last most drosse, in the middle-most Wax.

\29. *Next make the Wax into Balls./*/ The Wax waxing hard, make into Bals, squeesing out the water with your hands. When you have thus done, presently while they are warme breake all the Balls in (2.) small Crumlets into a Skillet or Kettle set over a (3.) soft fire. \30. *Last of all melt it and cast it in a mould./*/ While it is melting, stir it and skim it with a spoone (4.) wet in cold water: and as (5.) soone as it is melted and skimmed cleane, take it off. And having provided the (6.) mould, first (7.) warme the bottome, specially if the cake be small, and (8.) besmeare the sides with Honie, and then instantly poure in the wax (9) (being as coole as it may run) through a linnen straining-bag. When you come neere the bottome, peere it gently till you see the drosse comming: Which straine into some other mould by it selfe. And when it is cold, either trie againe, or having pared away the bottome, reserve it, as it is, for some use. 
When the Wax is in the mould, if any froth yet remaine upon it, blow it together at one side, and skim it off lightly with a wet spoone. 
\31.*And keepe the cake from cracking./*/ This done, set not the cake abroad, or where it may coole hastily upon, but in the warme house: and if it be great, cover the mould with a Plaster, as close as you can, to keepe the top from cooling, till the (10.) inward heat be alayed: and so let it stand, not moving the mould till the cake be cold. If it sticke, a little warming of the vessell or mould will presently loose it: so that it will slip out. 
(1.) So will they breake the smaller with lesse labour. (2.) That the wax may melt the sooner, and all together. (3.) For a rash fire will burne it, and change both colour and qualitie. (4.) That the skum sticke not. (5.) For over-heating will discolour the Wax, turning the bright yellow into a darke or reddish colour, not so commendable in Wax: for thereby it is knowne to have lost of his fatnesse and sweetnesse, and to be the worse for all uses. (6.) Which may be a bason or other vessell of mettall or earth, bigger upward than in the bottom. (7) Lest the Wax first poured in (which is the best) being presently cooled, lie beneath the drosse. (8.) To keepe the Wax from sticking to the sides of the mould, and consequently to helpe save the Cake from cracking. For Wax shrinketh in cooling, as new walles in drying: and therefore if the Cake sticke not, if shrinketh together from the sides, then must it needs cracke, one part shrinking from another (specially if it coole hastily upon) as it happneth commonly in great Cakes: For small ones, whose inward heat is

For the great heat of the Wax doth cast up the watrie vapours mingled with it: Which so long as the upper part of the Cake continueth liquid, doe easily passe: but when it is hardened, and the Wax yet fervent hot beneath; the vapours being violent through the inward heat, must needs either cracke the Cake, or heave it make it hollow, or both, specially if it be verie great: for then will the heat be both stronger and longer: but this is helped by not sticking. *v. ante num./* (8.)

In respect of which great vertues (28) the right composition of those great Antidotes *Treacle,/* and *Mithridate/* (although they consist, the one of more than fiftie, the other of more than sixtie Ingredients) requireth thrice so much Honie as of all the rest.

\7. *Two waies to clarifie Hony./*/ Honie is clarified by boiling: and that either by it selfe, or else with a fourth part of water, or other liquor. But alwaies in boiling skim it, that it may be pure. 
By it selfe you must boile it untill it will yeeld no more + skum, (which will be about halfe an houre) and that with a very soft fire, or in a + double vessell; lest, by over-heating, it get a bitter taste, and lest it suddainly run over and flame. 
[The]

===

$*Of the fruit and profit of Bees./*/$
 
+The right skum, which is drosse, is short and brittle: which when it is cleane taken away, the force of the fire will cause the very Hony to rise up like a skum: but that will then be tougher and more clammy than the drossie skum, and so will all the rest be, when it is cold, as being over-boiled: therefore be sure to take it off in time. 
+i. a vessell set in a vessell of boiling water, called, *Balneum Maria/* which is best.  
\V.Fernel.l.4.c.15./ With water it is to be boiled an houre at the least, even untill the water be evaporated: *v./*  which thing is knowne by the bubbles that rise from the bottom: then, to make it more pure, put into every pound of Hony the+ \+*Lesse white may serve, if the Honie be good./*/ white of one Egge, and afterward skim it againe in the boiling. The fire may be more fervent at the first; but toward the end it must be slacke: for it is then apt to be set on fire, as the meere Hony, and to become bitter with violent heat. 
The course Honie being boiled and clarified hath a pleasant taste, and is comparable for most uses to the purest bottom-honie being raw. 
Which pure Honie, if you be disposed to boile it, will aske lesse time to be clarified, as yeelding little or no skum at all: and in taste and vertue it is more excellent.
When your Honie is boiled enough, take it from the fire; and rather too soone, than too late: for if there bee any drosse remaining, you shall finde it in the top, when it is cold: but over-much boiling consumeth the spiritous parts of the Honie, and turneth the sweet taste into bitter. 
\8. *The quintessence of Honie./*/ And such is Honie in his owne kind, both raw and boiled. It is also altered by distillation into a water, which *Raimundus Lullius/* that excellent Chymist calleth the Quintessence of Honie. This Quintessence dissolveth Gold, and maketh it potable: likewise any sort of pretious stone that is put therein. It is of such vertue, that, if any be dying, and drinke two or three drammes therof, presently he will revive. If you wash any wound there-with, or otherfore; it will heale quickly. It is also good against the Cough, Catarre, and paines of the Melt, and against many other diseases. Being given for the space of six and fortie daies together to one that hath the Palsie, it helpeth him. Which thing

*John Hester/* a Practical Chymist, in his key of Philosophie, professeth himselfe to have proved. It helpeth also the falling sicknesse, and preserveth the body from putrefaction. Of so marvellous efficacie is this water. 
\10. *The making of it./*/ The making of is is after this manner. Take two pound of perfect pure Honie, and put it into a great Glasse, that foure parts of five may remaine emptie: +Lute it well with a Head and Receiver, and give it + fire untill there appeare certaine white Fumes: which, by laying wet clothes on the Receiver and Head, and changing them when they are warme, will turne into a water of a red colour like blood.  When it is all distilled, keepe the Receiver close shut, and let it stand till it be cleere, and of the colour of a Rubie. Then distill it in *Balneo Mariæ/* seven times; and so it will lose this reddish colour, and become yellow as Gold, having a great smell and exceeding pleasant. 
+The Lute may be made of Clay, Flocks, and Salt-water, tempered together; or of Meale and whites of Egges.
+The Lute being first dried in the Sunne or by the fire.
\11. *The vertue of Honie in Confections./*/ Now as Honie is good by it selfe, either altered or in his owne kinde; so is it also being mixt with many other Simples: which here to declare would seeme but tedious and impertinent. Notwithstanding it shall not be amisse, in two or three instances, to give you a taste of such Confections; and first of those that are inwardly, then of those that are outwardly received. 
Of the first sort are Marmalade, and Marchpane, preserved Fruits, as Plums, and Cherries, &c. Conserves of Roses, Violets, &c. with Syrups of the like matter. 
\12. *Marmalade made of Honie./*/ Marmalade is thus made. First boile your Quinces in their skins til they be soft: then, having pared and strained them, mix there-with the like quantitie of clarified Honie: and boile this together till it be so thicke, that in stirring (for you must continually stirre it for feare of burning) you may see the bottom; or, being cooled on a Trencher, it be thicke enoug to slice: then take it up and box it speedily. You may also adde a quantitie of Almonds, and Nut-kernels: also Cinamom, Ginger, Cloves and Mace, of each a like quan-

titie, pounded small and put into the Honie with the Quinces, and in boiling to be stirred together. This is very good to comfort and strengthen the stomack. For want of Quinces you may take Wardens, Peares, or Apples, and specially the Peare-maine, Giliflower, Pipin, and Roiall.
\13. *Marchpane./*/ Marchpane may be made after this manner. Boile and clarifie by it selfe, so much Honie as you think meet: when it is cold, take to every pound of Honie the white of an Egge, and beat them together in a Bason, till they be incorporat together and wax white, and when you have boiled it againe two or three walmes upon a fire of coles, continually stirring it, then put to it such quantitie of+ blanched Almonds or Nut-kernels stamped, as shall make it of a just consistence: and after a warme or two more, when it is well mixt, powre it out upon a Table, and make up your Marchpane. Afterward you may ice it with Rose-water and Sugar. This is good for the Consumption.
+Steepe them a night in cold water, and the peeles will come off.
\14. *Preserves./*/ 
*Preserve Fruits after this manner./* 
The Damascens, or other Fruit, being gathered fresh from the tree, faire, and in their prime, neither greene or sower, nor over-ripe or sweet, with their stalks, but cut short; weigh them, and take their weight in raw fine Honie: and putting to the Honie the like quantitie of faire water, boile it some halfe quarter of an houre, or till it will yeeld no skum: then having slit the Damascens in the dented side for feare of breaking, boile them in this liquor with a soft fire, continually skimming and turning them till the meat commeth cleane from the stone, and then take them up. If the liquor be then too thinne, boile it more: if in the boiling it be too thick, put in more faire water, or Rose-water if you like it. The liquor being of a fit consistence, lay up and preserve therein your Fruits.
If they be greater Fruits, as Quinces, Pipins, or the like; then shall it bee expedient, when you have bored them through the middle, or have otherwise coared them, to put them in as soone as the liquor is first skimmed: and then to let them boile till they be as tender as Quodlings.

\15. *Conserves./*/ Conserves of Roses is thus to be made. Take of the juice of fresh Red Roses one ounce, of fine Honie+ \*Melrosatum/* *Cum uncij aque tribus mediocriter despumetur. v.n.7./*/ clarified tenne ounces, boile this together: when it beginneth to boile, adde of the leaves of fresh Red Roses clipt with Scissors in little pieces foure ounces, boile them to the consumption of the juice, and presently put up the Conserves into some earthen vessell: Keepe it long therein: for in time it waxeth better and better. *Sylv.l.3 de med.simp.mist./* 
\Melviolatun./ 
\16. *Syrups. Syrup of Roses./*/ After the same manner is made Conserves of Violets. Syrup of Roses make thus. Steep fresh Roses in hot water over the Embers, (the vessel being covered) untill the Roses wax pale: then straine out the Roses, and put fresh in their places, until they are also pale: this doe ten times, or untill the water be red. And this being purged with Whites of Egges, (to every pinte of liquor one) boile it gently with like quantitie of fine Honie, untill it be of convenient thicknesse. If you prepare it for present uses, the lesse boiling will serve: if you meane to keepe it, it requireth more, for which purpose the sunning of it is good: This purgeth a little, specially being new. *Sylv.Med.S.Mist.l.3./* 
Or thus. Steep one pound of Red Rose leaves in foure pound of water foure and twentie houres. When the water is strained, put unto it two pound of fine Honie, and boile it to the thicknesse of a Syrup, taking of the skumme as it riseth. It tempereth the hot affections of the braine, it quencheth thirst, it strengthneth the stomacke, it procureth sleep, and stayeth thin rheumes *Fern.Meth.lib.7./* 
*Syrup of Violets./* The Syrup of Violets is made, after the same manner, of fragrant Violets, and steeped untill the liquor be blew. Being well boiled it may be kept a yeare without vinewing or corruption. It tempereth and purgeth hot and sharp humours; and therefore is good in a Pleurisie: it expelleth Melancholie and the effects thereof, as head-ach, waking, dreaming, and heavinesse of heart: it is fit to be used before, and after purging. *Plantius in Fernel. meth.l.7/*

\21. *The properties and vertues of/* Mede *and/* Methæglen/ What are the vertues and properties of *Meth/* or *Hydromel/* may partly be knowne by that which hath beene said of Honie.

The which, by the purifying in boyling, together with the accesse of sundry holsome ingredients, *v./* \*V.p.2.n.21.22&24./*/ are rather confirmed and increased, than any way extenuated or diminished. Therefore saith Lobel, *Mulsum, ubi aquæ plurimum mellis non multum, diuturnâ intestinâque mellis ebullitione in vinum longè utilissimum abit./* And Pictorius, *Hydromel longâ vetustate transit in vinum stomacho convenientissimum./* Meth, when it is old, is a Wine most agreeable to the stomack: it recovereth (1) the appetite being lost, it (2) openeth the passage of the Spirit or breath, it (3) softneth the belly, it (4) is good for them that have the cough.

well for pleasantnesse in taste, as for health; so being burnt it is better than any burnt Wine, for comforting and setling of a weake and sicke stomach, and for recreating the naturall heat.
The manner of burning it (if you know not) may be this. First set on the fire a + deepe Skillet or Kettle, almost full of water: when it boileth, put in a Pewter pot full of *Methæglen:/* before that beginneth to boile, skimme it and put in two or three bruised Cloves, and a branch of Rose-marie: then beat the yolke of an Egge in a dish, put into it a spoonefull of the *Meth/* cold, and stirre them together to keep the yolke from curdling: then put to that a spoonfull of the hot *Meth:/* and after that an other, and an other, alwaies beating them together: and then, some and some, put all into the pot, still stirring it about. Then as soone as it boileth, take up the pot, and, saving your hands harmlesse, powre it into another warme pot of like capacitie, firing it as it runneth: and so brue it till it will burne no more. A *Methæglen/*-posset is of the like vertue. 
+The deeper the pot standeth, the sooner it boileth. You may, for a need, set the pot on the Harth in the midst of hot Embers: but take heed the flame melt not the Pewter.

And then take the bottom of an other earthen pot, or a little round board with a handle in the middle like a Churn-staffe, but without holes: and having first wetted the bottom of it in cold water, dip it into the hot vessell, and assoone as this wet bottom toucheth the wax, pull it out againe, and you shall have sticking to the bottom a thin cake: which when you have taken off, wet the bottom againe, and dip it as before: and thus do till you have taken up all the wax in cakes. These cakes hang in the open aire upon a line drawne through them, so that they may not touch one an other, besprinkling them with water in the Sun-shine untill they be white. If any man would have wax whiter, let him boile it oftner, and do all other things in like manner as before.

These dissolve over a soft fire, and by and by take it off to coole a little. Afterward mix therewith the red Root of *Anchusa/* or +*Vermilion/*, well ground on a Marble or Glasse, and sweet Oile, of each one ounce: stirre all these and mix them well together. For want of *Vermilion/*, \+Cinabrium/ they take three times so much red Lead, but that is not so good. \Minimum./ 
\28. *To make greene Wax./*/ To make greene Wax, take in stead of *Vermilion,/* the like quantitie of *Vert-degreece./* 
\29. *Oile of wax./*/ And such is Wax in his kinde, both Naturall and Artificiall. Naturall Wax is altered by distillation into an Oile of marvelous vertue. *Raymond Lulli/* greatly commendeth it, proving it to be rather a Cœlestiall or Divine medicine than humane; because in wounds it worketh miraculously: which therefore is not so well allowed of the common Chirurgians. \30. *The vertues of it./*/ For it healeth a wound, be the same never so wide and big, being afore wide-stitched up, in the space of eleven daies or 12. at the most. But those that are small, this Oile healeth in three or foure daies, by annointing onely the wound therewith, and laying on a cloth wet in the same. It stayeth the shedding of the haire, either on the head or beard, by annointing the place therewith. 
Also for inward diseases, this Oile worketh miracles, if you give one drachme at a time to drinke with white Wine: for it is excellent in provoking urine which is stopped, it helpeth stitches and paines in the loines, it helpeth the cold Gout, or Sciatica, and all other griefes comming of cold. 
\31. * The making of Oile of Wax./*/ The making or drawing of this Oile is on this wise. Take of pure new yellow Wax so much as will halfe fill your Retort or Body of Glasse: melt it on the fire, and then powre it into sweete Wine, wherein let it soake: wash it often, and wring it between your hands: then melt it againe and powre it into fresh Wine, wherein soake it, wash it, and wring it as before, and this doe seven times, every time putting it into fresh Wine. When thus you have purified the Wax,

to every pound therof adding foure ounces of the powder of red Bricke finely bruised; put it all together into your Retort of Glasse well luted: *v./* \*V.n.10/*/ then set the Retort into an  Earthen pot, filling it round about and beneath with fine sifted Ashes or Sand; and set the pot with the Bodie in it on a Furnace, and so distill it with a soft fire. And there will come forth a faire yellow Oile, the which will congeale in the receiver like Pap when it is cold. If you should rectifie this oile or disill it often, untill it will congeale no more; then shall you make it over hot to take inwardly, and so quicke in the mouth, that you cannot drinke it downe. In the comming forth of this Oile, shall appeare in the Receiver, the foure Elements, the Fire, the Aire, the Water, and the Earth, right marvellous to see. 
\32. *The vertue of Wax in compound medicines./*/ So vertuous is Wax by it selfe, both in his owne kinde, and altered by distillation. It is moreover of great use mixed with others, and is the ground and foundation of *Cere-clothes/* and *Salves:/* whereof to set downe two or three examples shall not be amisse. 
\33. *A Cere-cloth./*/ A *Cere-cloth/* or *Ceratum,/* so called of *Cera,/* doth consist chiefly of Wax and Oile mixed in such proportion, as may make the ointment of just consistence: and therefore (1) being made in Summer, or compounded with Turpentine, Lard, Gum, Marrow, or any liquid thing, a greater quantity of Wax is required: and being made in Winter, or compounded with Rozin, Pitch, Metals, dried Hearbs, Powders, or any dry thing, a lesse quantity of Wax than Oile is convenient. 
The Ingredients being prepared, first melt the Wax, and whatsoever else of like nature, as Pitch, Suet, &c. in the Oile over a gentle fire, or in a double vessell, *v./* \*V.n.7./*/ for feare of burning: when they are melted together, put in the Powders and other like Ingredients, if there be any: and assone as you have stirred them well together, (before the liquor be very hot) set it a cooling and make your *Cere-cloth./*

\34. *A Cere-cloth to refresh the Sinews and Muscles./*/ A *Cere-cloth/* to refresh the wearied Sinewes and tired Muscles is thus to be made. Take (2) Oile and Wax *ana/* two ounces, Turpentine two drams, & Hony halfe an ounce. 
\35. *A Cere-cloth to comfort the stomacke./*/ To comfort the stomacke and helpe concoction, make a *Cerat/* thus. Take (3) Oile of Masticke, of Mint, of Wormwood, of Nutmeg, and +Speeke, or any of these, and a convenient quantitie of Wax. \+Nardinum/ 
\36. *A Cere-cloth for the Wormes./*/ For the wormes in the belly of a childe or other, Take Wax and Rozin *Ana/* one ounce, Treacle one spoonfull, Aloes two drams. Melt & mingle the Wax & Rozin together in a Pewter-dish, upon a Chasing-dish and Coales: being melted, skimme it cleane: then taking it off, put in the Treacle, and stirre it upon, and stirre it in, so that it may not be clod. And if, by this time, it be too cold to come from the dish: warme it a little upon the Chafing-dish againe: then having wet the Table with Butter, poure it thereon, and worke it together with your knife: and so make it up in a Roule. To make the Dish cleane, warme it, and wipe it with a woollen cloth. 
This *Cerat/* is to be applied to the Brest, and to the Navell. For the Navell, spread it upon a round peece of Leather three inches over, with a hoale in the middle; that, the Navell comming through, the plaister may lie both closer and faster: and for the Brest, spread it upon a square peece three inches broad, and twice so long: and lay it athurt the Brest, betweene, or close under the Paps.
This doe twice together, and let the Plasters remaine each time upon the place, untill the heat of the stomacke have dried them, and made them loose: which, in some that are much troubled with the wormes, will be within foure and twentie houres; although in some they will sticke a whole weeke together.

It asswageth inflammation, it cleanseth, it closeth, and filleth with flesh, and maketh whole. It is thus made: + Takethe juice of Parsley, Plantan, and Betonie, *ana/* one pound: Wax, Pitch, Rozin, and Turpentine, *ana/* halfe a pound: boile the Wax, Pitch, and Rozin in the Juices, softly stirring all together, untill the quantitie of the Juices be wasted: and then taking them off the fire, put in the Turpentine and mix it with the rest. 

*Another of like effect./*

\38. *Another./*/ Take Deere or Mutton-Suet, Wax, Rozin, *ana/* two ounces: Turpentine one ounce: boile these together, and skim them: then take this liquor from the fire, and, when it is somewhat cooled, put in two handfulls of the Tops of unset Hysop, and stirre it about, and setting it over the fire againe, boile it softly about a quarter of an houre, till it be greene: and then straine it, and let it coole. This is chiefly to bee made in *May,/* because then the Hysop is in his prime.
